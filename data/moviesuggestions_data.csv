Its beautifully made, very engaging and totally batshit. \n\nIf you\'re not familiar with Takashi Miike, he has a bunch of pretty intense films - but I\'d say **Visitor Q** (2001) is the one that combines weirdness with the disturbing most. Its also one of his absolute best, with the uncomfortable craziness increasing to a point were you just have to shake your head and laugh.   \n\n\nAnyway, I have a list of films like this over on Mubi - you might find more stuff you like there:  [https://mubi.com/lists/unpleasant-movies](https://mubi.com/lists/unpleasant-movies)  \n\n\nI also co-host a podcast called **Unpleasant Movies**, where we talk about films that are really hard to watch, but at the same time deals with its themes in a interesting way - typically with an artistic agenda. We\'ve done I Stand Alone and Irreversible by Noe, and are currently focusing on Takashi Miike. The episodes go kind of in-depth, and we don\'t heed spoilers, so its best to have seen the films before or know that you never want to.

Carmel, NY and meet post-encephalatic patients reviewing their life from a vessel which they’ve been trapped in. Dr. Sacks was one of the leading researchers in the fight against Parkinson’s being the first to have assembled a history of the disease. In order to combat this amalgamation of malfunctions, Shock said the medical community needs to combine resources and focus attention on finding causes rather than treating side effects. Like a leukemia patient mustering every bit of strength and technology within their means to rid themselves of cancer, the pharmaceutical industry would need to unite to put to rest this end of life mental degeneration. This book accounts the introduction of L-DOPA a dopamine antagonizer that revitalized catatonic patients to a level of youth they didn't know was within them. Before an age where 1/8 of people are on antidepressants, Dr. Sacks found the key to a healthy sustainable life is holding onto that enlightenment and continuously refining the sense of self.

Its seriously well written and the acting is top notch.

That is: how do soft creatures or morphing soft tissue characters sound according to examples from popular culture. This analysis is to be used to create my own sound design for a soft bodied robot.

So far, I have found examples in the following movies:

The Blop (1958)
Alien (1979)
The Thing (1982)
Night of the Creeps (1985)
Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)
Flubber (1997)

70,2020-09-14 14:04:17,isrkba,suggest,34,"So I just watched this German movie called 303 (2018) and I fell in love with the movie. 
It's about two strangers who are University students who go on a road trip for different reasons. 

This movie reminded me strongly of the before trilogy as the entire movie is based on conversations and the chemistry between the two lead actors. The dialogues revolve around capitalism, love, philosophy, evolution and just so many other interesting things. The dialogues are so natural that it's hard to belive that it comes from a script
The movie really makes you want to packup your bag, meet a stranger and fall in love. 
Everything about the movie- the landscapes, the acting, the music, the storyline, the adventures- everything just makes you feel good.

93,2020-09-14 05:20:43,isi9n2,suggest,45,"I hadn't read Iain Reid's novel so I wasn't quite prepared for what I was about to watch, but I've generally appreciated Charlie Kaufmann's films so I had an idea I was going to need to put on my abstract thinking cap to understand it. It was one of those movies that I didn't appreciate until I started to piece what was happening right at the end. I'll be honest, I don't think I pieced everything together, so I might need to rewatch again or maybe gain some context on the couple of things that confused me. But what I did take away from it and from my understanding was a powerful sense of loneliness and sadness. The long drawn out car scenes were extremely tense, I was hanging on every word. The night at the parents house equally so and also chilling and unnerving. The acting is suburb all round. I'm Thinking of Ending Things takes a lot of similarities of the themes of Eternal Sunshine but makes it a million times bleaker. It may not be a fun watch, but it's a fascinating and emotional one.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things,"['Trying to not spoil, but afraid the examples themselves are kind of spoiling:  Harvey, Fight Club, and The Shining are a few similar examples where characters who were real only to those in the story.  One may add Donnie Darko, Psycho, A Beautiful Mind (very subtle direct references to ABM in this movie actually) and I’m sure dozens of other examples. I would argue Psycho is one of the finest examples of this, and as much as I’d hate to ever watch Fight Club again, it’s a great example of imaginary characters driving the plot. \n\nThe question implies a level of detail not implied in my statement “this kind of thing”.  I’ve seen a number of deathbed movies retelling ones life and several of imaginary characters. Some of the best are the posthumous Lean films (Lawrence of Arabia and Ghandi, for example).  This does bring up an interesting point that any retelling of one’s deathbed story is partially fabrication, coming from the view of the one passing, but that’s not what’s written here, it’s an implication the viewer may make.  \n\nIn an artistic sense, one may derive similar meaning from Kaufman’s own body of work, (like Anomolisa for example) but I don’t think that’s a problem at all.  His work has a lot to say about how we perceive the world so I think that’s fitting.   I’ve often heard it said that storytellers only really have one story to tell and are bound to retell it their entire career.  To be sure, the closing shot here RE-grounds this to reality to reinforce the reality and draw a distinction between the imagined and real, so I think the question of subtlety is moot.  \n\nI feel this could have been at least as interesting and effective in 90 minutes... seemed no more / less necessary to go on for another 10-90 hours to fill entire seasons of a Netflix show.', '""Getting the references"" is in no way the point of the movie - in fact you are closer to the intended reception if you *don\'t* get most of them, as the degree of depth and specificity of the thoughts in his mind during what\'s happening to him *are* kinda the whole point.\n\nIt\'s not surprising that you\'d come away thinking it ""never seems to get going"" if you watched the movie while worrying about correctly identifying every reference as if it was a live action trivia quiz, or something. It misses the point.', ""&gt; been done before and done better, IMO\n\nWhich movies have done &gt;!the characters of the movie all being imaginary inside the main character's head as they commit suicide in the real world!&lt; before and better? Very curious about this, thanks!"", 'I only watched only 10 seconds of the trailer before i quit and thought ""the voice acting sounds brilliant (watched it in German) and this could be good...I\'ll watch it this evening"".\n\nBoy was this movie different from what I expected :D  \n\nI expected some kind of rom com or a ""typical"" romance drama and was hit with this thing. But, even if it was completely different from what I expected, I really enjoyed this movie. If you don\'t mind watching movies which:\n\n*take their time to develop themselves (first 20 minutes is the protagonists having a converstaion in the car)\n*focus on conversation (there\'s no action going on)\n*give much room for interpretations \n\nthen you could like this movie. This movie is full of metaphors, tiny details and mysteries but doesn\'t quite give an explanation to what is going on. \n\n**My Interpretation ----Spoilers**\n\nJake is an old man who works as a Janitor at a High School and everything we saw of ""young Jake and Lucy"" is in his imagination. He is lonely, sad and maybe sick -and because of that, he knowingly created an imaginary world, where he is young,has a girlfriend and everything is better. \n\n**Who is Lucy?:**  The Lucy that we know, is an imaginary version of a woman that Jake saw years ago. In the scene where imaginary Lucy meets the real Jake, she tells him (and us) how she experienced this evening. They didn\'t talk and he doesn\'t know her name or what she does for a living. That\'s why her name (Lucy, Lucia, Louise) and her profession (physicist, gerontologist, painter ) change throughout the movie. The only constant thing about imaginary Lucy is the way she looks and sounds.  That fact that imaginary Lucy talks to real Jake is making it obvious, that he knowingly created that imaginary world and isn\'t just delusional. \n\n**Jake\'s life regarding his parents:** \n* Jake lived with his parents all his life and he took care of them when they were getting old (mom getting a tinnitus and later bedridden, dad getting Alzheimer\'s). Jake was an ambitious (he won a prize) man who was clever(""genius""), a good painter and knows a lot about literature and other stuff.  That\'s what the scenes in the house tell us. \n\n*Some details (like imaginary Jake moving his head away from his mother ) make me think that  he is blaming them a bit for his misery -  ""I couldn\'t pursue my dreams because I had to take care of you"".\n\n\n**Jake\'s life regarding women:**  Jake always had problems with women  and he knows about how he comes off to women. This is shown in several scenes during the movie: \ne.g. When real Jake is working, two schoolgirls are making fun of him behind his back.  The lonely girl walking the corridors is just looking at him and the schoolgirl singing the musical is looking at him in disgust.  All these girls show up later, e.g. when imaginary Jake and Lucy are at the Tootsietown and he tells Lucy that  people sometime can be cold to him and that she has to order because no one will come, if it\'s only him.\n\n The aforementioned scene of imaginary Lucy meeting real Jake also shows that he is aware of how he comes off to women. \n\n\n**Why do I think that Jake might be sick?:** When imaginary Jake shows imaginary Lucy the barn, Lucy asks Jake what happened to the pigs. He told her that they died - being eaten alive from the inside be maggots.  I think that is a metaphor to Jake - he is the (fat) pig. Maybe he is having a tumor and he knows thatr this thing is eating him alive until he dies. Maybe his thoughts and emotions are eating him alive - he is constantly questioning himself ""what if..?"" , which is making him miserable.', ""The other thread had zero discussion and hardly any views because it was posted the day it came out.

We discussed after the first viewing and we both had arrived at the same conclusion about the ending (what the ""book"" ending is supposed to be).

It was subtle in the movie but after the picture scene it had a clear direction and drove all the way there.

I would even disagree with how she characterizes the scenes with the parents because I think it was telling important parts of that same line of thought (if you view it after accepting the picture scene as important).\n\nIt was a good review and informative for those who haven't read the book, though- thank you for posting!"", ""Nah he's right, I got a bit too cute with my response.

This would better work as a special feature to THAT movie, or a DVD COMMENTARY featuring Brian Cox in character lamenting the VO and “don’t waste my time  / have something to say”.\n\nWhile I feel like I got at least most of the references from the room (I did think the Pauline Kael impression was particularly great), the whole thing felt like an overwrought first draft from a first time screen writer with a lot to prove.  While I’m glad I watched it (mainly because I’ve always wondered about a screenplay taking lonesome neurosis to an extreme by having full quotations of Oscar speeches a person had rewatched or similar specific occurrences), I can see this kind of thing just doesn’t work. Even if you get the references, it’s not because you’re aiming at the smartest person in the audience, it’s just a fluke. \n\nFrom a “figuring it out” perspective, I took this as an unfinished screenplay written by the janitor early on in his life and everything more or less fit that narrative until later on.\n\nI’ll always seek out Charlie Kaufman movies, but this was a letdown.

But it took me a few days afterwards and the fact that my mind kept coming back to the movie to finally appreciate and like it. Imo it\'s not a movie for everyone and, in a lot of ways, it\'s hard to go through. But it still a pretty strong experience. And the sense of loneliness it gave me hit me pretty hard. I think for me it will be one of those movies that stay with me for a long time.\n\nEdit: most of movie felt like going through the motions of one of my dreams  - the constant changes, that sometimes get absurd, but that the characters just accept without much questionin, the ""outerness"" of the setting, where right after the begining  all locations seem separated from the ""bigger world"" - that\'s pretty much the way I usually dream.', 'What would you recommend than', ""I loved this, it's #7 on my list of films this year but also, I am very wary of recommending it to anyone."", 'Love Charlie Kaufman but I couldn’t get through it either.

Without reading the book I’d say you’re left really confused, which is a shame because the ending in the book was perfectly executed.', 'Edit: Potential spoiler removed', 'I couldn’t even get through it.

119,2020-09-13 19:32:08,isabqa,request,13,"Hello everybody!

Last month, I have entered in anime world and discovered one of the best visual shows in my life. It is the work of Yoshiaki Kawajiri .  I saw everything from him and  visual style with crazy good drawings of characters is just best ever!  Most of the anime from 80s-2000s kinda look better then now-days animations, in my opinion.

Things like:

 "" Ninja Scroll"",

"" Highlander: The Search For Vengeance"", 

""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""

""Redline""

Those were few examples of visual style and atmosphere I like.  I am not sure who is most responsible for this crazy good vibe in those anime besides Director Kawajiri.

So if you can help me find key people from those animations I listed above. Or if you could recommend me some similar stuff feel free to do it, because I will be grateful for life!

122,2020-09-13 18:33:02,is9ckb,request,124,"I just want to watch a film where I fall in love with the main character

You know when you've watched a film and there's just someone who gets your heart going and everything they do is perfect? I wanna feel that

Criteria:
-in their early/mid 20s
-not ""try hard"" sexy
-not an overly sexual film
-tattoos/brown hair are a bonus but not a necessity 

Genre doesn't matter

But some examples of some guys I that made me feel like that:

-Jack Dawson (Titanic)
-Jughead Jones (Riverdale)
-Jacob Black (Twilight)

Just guys that are sweet, romantic and/or mysterious

Also please note, those films are NOT my typical taste. 99% of what I watch is psychological thrillers and they don't tend to have cute dudes 

This is very random and I feel ashamed for this but I'm just lonely lmao

OR a series like outer banks where there's lots of beautiful men to choose from

(just nothing cringy like that film with that necky noah dude)

EDIT: I'm not into ""manly"" men. I don't know how else to word it but guys like Ryan Gosling, Chris Hemsworth, Zac Efron etc. The guys I like (see examples) are all very smooth faced pretty boys.

more be a ""visual"" world than a world with its own thematic rules.\n\n- Some Méliès films, while being very short films, are really rich and have the first signs of a world building, at least visually coherent - you see it in *The Impossible Voyage*, *A Trip to the Moon*, *The Kingdom of the Fairies*...\n\n- The Danish film *A Trip to Mars* (Holger-Madsen, 1914) creates a fantasized civilized Mars, but it\'s more a metaphor (the world you meet there is inhabited by humans, or at least humans look-alike) than a real new universe, even if it has it\'s own style (ancient Greece style, to sum-up).\n\n- German expressionism builds a lot of fantasized worlds (*Caligari*, *The Golem*...), but it\'s more visually once again. \n\n- With *King Kong*-like films (exotic/fantastic/horror of those years) you can try *The Lost World* (1925) or *Island of Lost Souls* (1932).\n\n- *A Matter of Life and Death* (Powell/Pressburger, 1946) invent its own version of paradise, but it\'s still paradise and not a whole new universe. \n\n- Later, *Beauty and the Beast* by Cocteau and *Donkey Skin* by Demy, even if they are famous tales adaptations, build their own personnal universe around them (it\'s mostly true for the demy film).\n\n- I have the feeling that the thing more close to what you\'re searching for are serials, like *Flash Gordon* (who inspired *Star Wars* - 1936&gt;1940), but i don\'t know it very well. I suppose that a lof of SF B-movie from the 50\' have also something to offer, but it\'s not always convincing.\n\nI must forget very important things, but that\'s all i can think of for now!', 'Maybe Zardoz, that bizzare 70s cult movie, featuring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling, it was a 74 movie now that I looked it up so I think it qualifies']",4

148,2020-09-13 11:22:08,is189x,suggest,49,"I feel like this one may fly under the radar for many, but it's a really cool look into the world of an agent for a private intelligence firm, whose clientele includes major corporations. This agent is then tasked with infiltrating those who would look to terrorize or interrupt said corporations, gathering information on them, and taking them down. 

The movie has a GREAT Autumn/cold weather vibe, and I really think most would enjoy it. It had me locked in pretty much from start to finish. I honestly think the [trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oPoTrnHQ3I) do a horrible job at selling the film, because the actual movie itself feels WAY different, and far cooler. Let me know what you think!","""The East"" - My Go-To Movie to Start the Fall","['I think you\'re misinterpreting my post slightly. The premise is fine. In no way do I think it needs a ""political advisor,"" and it certainly doesn\'t have to be realistic to be a great movie. For example, I love Jaws, but understand that sharks don\'t generally stalk and murder a boatload of people. It\'s just great movie making. Transversely, I think the East is a bad movie. I think the script is bad. I think the acting is bad. I also find it\'s portrayal of political activism ignorant to the point of being offensive, and sometimes it\'s difficult to see something that has importance and receives very little mainstream coverage, get trampled beyond recognition by the Hollywood machine. \n\nIf it is supposed to be a popcorn fantasy movie, why didn\'t they sell it as that? Why did they choose to mercilessly bog this movie down in self-importance? I never felt duped by Lucy into taking it seriously, and it turns out it wasn\'t. I didn\'t watch the trailer for Limitless and go, ""I bet this is going to be a dead-serious treatise on drug-induced intelligence expansion,"" and it wasn\'t. Both of those movies seemed to be exactly what they were sold as...fun movie-going experiences. I don\'t watch those movies expecting anything else. I think The East was trying really, really hard to be taken very, very seriously. I think the screenwriter, the filmmakers, and the actors all saw it that way. I think they wanted this to be, ""an important movie.""  Maybe I\'m wrong. This is all just conjecture on my part, after all. Maybe they were really trying to make Lucy, and it all just went over my head. But I don\'t think so. \n\nIf you enjoy The East, that\'s totally fine. I guarantee you that I enjoy many movies that you might not like. I also guarantee that we have many movies in common that we would both endorse. The East is not going to be one of them though. And that\'s fine too. There are always going to be ""people that do critics like you did,"" in this world. There are always going to be opinions that may oppose yours, and thank god for it, right? \n\nFor what its worth, I appreciate your lengthy and thoughtful reply, and I\'m glad you feel as passionate about movies as I do. Cheers.', ""I never understand people that do critics like you did. The East is fiction so it can be what it wants, can't it? Its like people hating on Lucy and limitless because the premise is false (that its not true that you don't use 10% of your brain and that you can unlock the rest somehow). Even if the premise is false, you can watch the movie and enjoy it, can't you? I am always surprised when I read critics saying: I hated that movie because it's not true that you can take a pill and unlock the other 90% of your brain. Are you that stubborn that you couldn't go through the first 5 minutes of the movie? There are E.Ts in that movie, and the thing that stopped you from watching it is the premise?\n\nDid you start watching The East thinking it would be a documentary? No then why does it matter?\n\n Sure, they took a stance and a political one, but its fiction so you do what you want with it. It never claimed to be 100% accurate. Plus, unless its factual taking political stance doesn't mean that you have to be accurate. \n\nLet's say you were watching Food inc. and it tells you about the food industry but it spreads lies, sure you would be right to criticize it for not being factual as it's trying to convince you that the meat industry is totally wrong-doing. \n\nBut I don't think you need a political advisor to create fiction like in The East as much as you don't need a political advisor to create James Bond or The Hunger games. \n\nThe same thing happened in the movie Michael Clayton, its a mix of real events and fiction and people go mad about it being non-factual. Who cares? The movie isn't trying to brainwash you, it's not trying to throw some propaganda at you, it's showing you a possible outcome and a possible build-up to events through fiction. What you do with that information is all yours."", ""Pretty disheartening to see OP's post upvoted so strongly, and your response getting the downvotes that it has. The East absolutely felt like a teen-ified, shallow, wannabe-revolutionary-cult piece. Can't say much more without just parroting what you wrote, but I do want to say that Alexander Skarsgard's English-language acting usually hovers somewhere around tolerable and, if given a very specific and narrow role, can even be fairly enjoyable.

Well anyway, it was a hitwoman movie. Now I want to watch a good one.

I liked *In Bruges* (2008) (no fights almost, but great everything else, not like Ava which had a cliché story and the character build up was in the fucking intro jesus christ) but I also liked the john wicks (a lot of fights, but well choregraphed fights, not like in fucking Ava where it makes zero sense, horrible)

201,2020-09-12 13:28:04,irhw5k,suggest,6,"I just saw Touch of Evil (1958) last night and I was honestly blown away. It’s written and directed by Orson Welles, and in my opinion I find most of his movies to be overrated, especially the Magnificent Ambersons.  The movie stars Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, and Orson Welles himself—all of which do a great job. Orson Welles in his heavy weight makeup really adds to the character, and Captain Quinlan seems like a real person, rather than being a character played by Orson Welles. The subject matter is really interesting in my opinion, focusing on corruption and the crime underbelly around the US-Mexico border, and the set design really plays into the setting of the story. What really made this movie stand out was Orson Welles’s directing. The shots are super dynamic, with interesting angles and great usage of light. That opening scene alone, the one take shot following the car through the streets of Mexico as it reaches the border, is amazing. It’s so smooth and adds so much suspense just at the very start of the movie, which sets up the rest of the film. I highly highly highly recommend this movie and I give it my very exclusive rating of 10/10, 100%",WATCH Touch of Evil (1958),"[""*^(Replying after taking permission from mod)* \n\nIn the comments on this post I found these movies available to stream and here are the details which can help you decide tonight's movie faster - \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Title**|**IMDb**|**Rotten Tomatoes**|**Metacritic**|**Where to watch**|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|[Touch Of Evil (1958)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Touch+Of+Evil+1958)|[8.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052311/)|[96%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/770711971)|99|[Redbox](https://www.redbox.com/ondemand-movies/touch-of-evil) [Amazon Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Apple Itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/touch-of-evil/id281730766?uo=4&amp;at=1000l3V2)|\n|[Blown Away (1994)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Blown+Away+1994)|[6.2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109303/)|[32%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/14857)||[Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/Blown-Away-RlZaL3lCMEJYbGtPZGFyNVMyV3Z4dz09)|\n|[The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Magnificent+Ambersons+1942)|[7.7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035015/)||93|[Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/The-Magnificent-Ambersons-VDZiMHVYTFRlYnBjTCtkSGhMVStZUT09)|\n|[The Border (1982)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Border+1982)|[6.4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083678/)|[80%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/14693)|66|[Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11031661)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nP.S. - You can help me predict movie names better by putting names between quotes while commenting. \n\n[PM the Creator](https://www.reddit.com/user/yzalthree)"", 'My favorite noir.', ""It's a great film, I've watched it several times.""]",3

The plot was amazing, but what I loved the most was the visuals and cinematography(?) of it. When I finished it, I was left with this kind of empty feeling in my chest.

But anything is fine, just looking for a movie that really captures that magical, fantasy feeling. Thanks in advance!

I could go on but then I'd be making my own suggestions :)",I like period films with substance,"['I’ve seen all of Tarkovskys movies two or more times and I still find Solaris to be very slow. On the contrary, Andrei Rublev’s three hour run time flies by, plus there’s an intermission if you need to take a break.', ""&gt; Andrei Rublev\n\nThe concept of this one seems solid, I think I found some of Tarkovsky's other films difficult to sit through though. I'm not sure if it was that I was tired and it was slow, or what... I am willing to give him another shot though!"", '&gt; theeb 2014\n\nWow - this movie looks fucking great. How can these slip under the radar!?\n\nThank you!', 'theeb 2014\n\nThe Message 1976 ((basically the story of islam and muhammed,a well-made film and oh anthony quinn is in it))', 'Andrei Rublev', '&gt;Far From the Madding Crowd\n\nthanks kindly :)', 'Saw that one, great film - thanks :)', 'Thanks!', '&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you :)', ""*^(Replying after taking permission from mod)* \n\nIn the

238,2020-09-12 00:34:04,ir6x6n,request,10,"Titles. Just rewatched The Forbidden Kingdom, remembering it as a decent time, and it was kind of humorous and it had many of the elements I liked, Portal Fantasy, Hero's Journey, Martial Arts (really any fighting as a backdrop is fine; I just like seeing characters at odds), but it was terribly overacted, and simultaneously underacted, it felt like some characters could have had more depth, and it really never felt like the character arcs and plot came together at the end. But I also actually kind of loved the visual story telling in the movie, the colour palette, and the way characters were framed visually. I guess, in order of importance...

&amp;#x200B;

* Visuals. I want something with a vibrant colour pallette, with the colours of classical chinese art (vibrant reds, and stunning scenery) being preferred, but mostly just a vibrant colour palette with strong visual storytelling. I absolutely loved the cherry blossom scene, for example.
* Some sort of fantasy, preferably Wuxia, but I'd settle for something Japanese or Korean themed, or even European if it comes to it. 
* Characters. I want characters who...Aren't one note? Who have more than one reason for doing something and don't necessarily have obvious goals from the start. It doesn't have to be presented upfront like a novel or a textbook; it can just be told in the feel of scenes with a lot left to audience interpretation, but I just kind of want something there to chew on.
* A plot that really weaves those characters together. And challenges what those characters really want to do, what they stand for, and who they stand with.
*  And if it can be swung, a portal fantasy training arc (as in TFK), and failing that, a regular hero's journey would do.
* And while I'm asking for the moon, a more subtle, contemplative music score wouldn't hurt ;P

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I know this isn't the greatest way to ask, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding quite what I'm looking for from google because a lot of this is kind of subjective or based on feel. If it helps, and I know this is anime (sort of) and not a movie, but Thunderbolt Fantasy was also an amazing experience for me.","Looking for a ""The Forbidden Kingdom""...

240,2020-09-12 00:08:14,ir6m3x,request,52,"I've been on a kick lately with movies set in the United Kingdom, and I'd like to find some more great ones.  While I'm hesitant to label my taste here as ""working class"" movies, I'm enjoying movies about normal, everyday people (as opposed to movies about royalty, Jane Austen period dramas, etcetera).  


Some that I've quite enjoyed along these lines:  


• *Calendar Girls*

• *Made In Dagenham*

• *The Full Monty*

• *The Commitments*

• *Ladies In Lavender*

• *Vera Drake*

• *Sid &amp; Nancy* (well, *sorta* normal people!)

• *Red Joan*

• *Bloody Sunday*

• *Mrs. Henderson Presents*

• *Death At A Funeral*

• *In The Name Of The Father*

• *Notes On A Scandal*  


Of course, I'm not against a good historical piece—I dearly loved *The Queen* and *The King's Speech*, and *Mrs. Brown* and *Victoria &amp; Abdul* are a *perfect* double-feature in my book.  But I'm more looking for what UK residents might consider relatively ""mundane"" (I quite enjoyed the village-centric television series *Jam And Jerusalem,* if that helps).  And I'd like to explore more movies set in Ireland/Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.  


Any suggestions most appreciated!","UK movies of ""real"" life","[""I keep forgetting that I need to finish up [*Marriage Lines*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Lines) with her and Richard Briers (or at least what's left of the show—from what I gather, many episodes have been lost due to that old BBC policy of wiping and reusing videotape)."", 'That one sounds good.  I really loved [*The Shipping News*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVhaoPGBtV8) that Rhys Ifans was in.', ""Another vote for 'Withnail &amp; I'\n\nEast Is East\n\nRita, Sue, and Bob Too\n\nKes\n\nDead Man's Shoes"", ""Please check out 'Withnail and I'\n\nCult dark comedy and nothing quite like it."", ""If you're interested in Welsh films/Wales, then definitely check out Twin Town."", '[deleted]', '[deleted]', 'Hers is only a supporting role - but she is quite good - and it is interesting so see her so young.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.', 'That might be worth watching just for a young Prunella Scales!', 'Just to clarify, the series *follows* the film?  Might check out both!', 'Ugh—I\'ll have to make darned sure I don\'t get the American release.  Apparently it has been hacked to shreds to make it more palatable for us ""dumb Americans"".  WHY is it folks on the other side of the pond think Americans are too ignorant to catch cultural references?  I *know* who Richard and Judy are.  I\'ve watched *Only Fools And Horses*.  \n\n\nGood lord, they renamed *Jam &amp; Jerusalem* to *Clatterford* when they released it in America because they thought we wouldn\'t know what the WI was or what the phrase referred to.  Hell, they explain it in one of the very first episodes!  \n\n\nOkay, off soapbox—thank you for the suggestion.', ""I'm appreciative of the bot, but honestly, I'm getting much better responses from flesh-and-blood Reddit users.   🙂"", 'Oh yeah, I saw that as a recommendation somewhere.  Need to add that to the watch list.', ""I'm quite cool with dark.  :-)"", 'LOL.  Better banshees and leprechauns than Agnes Brown.   😁', ""Awesome! Also check out Ken Loach's movies. Lots of working class stories, but I haven't seen many of them."", ""I would like to see one really good, really detailed movie which explains the origins of the Troubles.  I've been reading about it recently, but I'm finding the information is rarely comprehensive and tends to focus on specific events—the hunger strikes, Bloody Sunday, the Guildford Four, etcetera.  Never something which covers the history of it from beginning to modern day.  (Admittedly, I might be asking more for something from the History Channel or National Geographic than a simple theatrical film.)  \n\n\nI have been looking for *Nil By Mouth* for ages, and never seem to can find it on the streaming services.  Might have to break down and buy it outright on DVD—love Kathy Burke, and she got huge acclaim for this one."", ""As long as it's a good film, I don't mind going back in time at all.  The Welsh movies are of particular interest to me—I know so little about Wales.  (And as much as I enjoyed it, I'm sure [*You Should Have Left*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw0-cV_J9q4) is *hardly* representative.)"", 'Quite liked Colman in *The Favourite*.  How explicit is the dog scene?  Not a fan of violence against animals…', 'Glad I could help.', ""BBC Films and UK Film Council—that's *always* a clue that the movie will be excellent."", 'Yes, *Trainspotting* was quite good.  Been meaning to get around to the sequel.  The television show suggestions are appreciated, but I\'m trying to steer clear of anything which hasn\'t completed its run.  I got seriously hooked on *Orange Is The New Black*, and was pulling my hair out every year after binging the newest season—""*I gotta wait a freakin\' YEAR for more!*""  \n\n\n*Peaky Blinders* shall be on the binge list when it\'s done.', '*Eden Lake* sounds quite good.  And like what another person suggested, might have to watch *24 Hour Party People* just for the soundtrack.  \n\n\n""The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""—that might be the single most helpful thing I\'ve heard yet.  Thank you for that!', 'Wow, might have to watch that one just for the soundtrack.', 'Not familiar with *any* of those—look forward to checking them out!', ""How about a period comedy/drama involving 'real' people?\n\n[Hobson's Choice (1954)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047094/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) - set in 1880s Salford, England."", 'Young offenders if your looking to have a laugh, definitely say

Basically it opens with a long take of a couple walking home while they're having a conversation. After they reach the apartment, if I remember correctly, he rapes her but it isn't shown because the camera travels backwards.

And the second movie I can't find anywhere contains a really weird voyeur-ish almost pornographic scene with a guy straight up having sex with a girl on a table. I believe they were in some place kind of like an interrogation room. All I know is they were korean actors.

That's all I have. Maybe some of you film wizards can help me find both movies!

256,2020-09-11 17:07:57,ir0e2l,suggest,0,"!Spoiler Alert! 
I'm thinking of ending things is a movie that starts out being seemingly normal, where a young woman goes with her boyfriend Jake to meet his parents
This review is gonna contain spoilers, so if you haven't watched the film you should stop reading this right noe



As soon as the couple reach the parent's house we start seeing that things are becoming strange, and that's when we start having the real feel of the movie


The parents seem to get younger and older in each scene, at first it's not as noticeable, but then it becomes more significant

And Jake's girlfriend's name and clothes keep changing, as well as her occupation


From the beginning we're seeing these random scenes of an old man who works as a janitor in a school

Towards the end of the movie we come to understand that this janitor is Jake, and that the whole movie takes place in his head just before he commits suicide


I'm thinking of ending things is a blurry and disturbing vision of aging, loneliness and accepting yourself.
It's a fantasy of what the main character's life could have been


The whole movie is a battle between Jake's unwillingness to see his true self and accepting who he is

It gives us a chance to experience what it's like inside the head of a broken spirit on a journey to ending their life


Throughout the course of the movie, it creates an eerie atmosphere that keeps the viewers feeling uneasy

That's how Jake's last thoughts were, and that's exactly what the movie wants you to feel while watching.

It deals with some important existential and social problems

It is a movie about feeling unfulfillment in your life.

It is a movie about feeling trapped in your own existence, hating who you are and hating your place in this world.

It is a movie about feeling like an outcast in society, and not really knowing why.

It is a movie about lost hope of what would have happened if we made better choices in our lives.



Old, lonely and tired, Jake creates a fantasy of an ideal woman that he never had in his life, and how things would have turned out if he had.


We see this woman and how she changes from scene to scene


And because the girl is fictional, we never understand her as a character, because she's constantly adapting to his ongoing fantasy about her


One can even say that she has no character at all 
As she is just a compilation of media induced ideas of the perfect female companion

But in the last scenes we see that even in his head, Jake does not give himself the right to be perceived well by a woman 

And we see this nameless woman's actions change from what he would like them to be to what he thinks they would have been in reality 

As she drastically changes from searching for him to being surprised to even noticing him. Its a constant battle in his head where he needs to be accepted while at the same time knows he never be.


Everything comes to its place when naked he goes inside the school following the pig, and the pig is who makes it clear to us 
The pig is an embodiment of how he perceived himself

And the pig tells him that it's only when you accept who you are and let things go that you find peace

And only in his final moments that he realizes that it's ok to be this lonely and unloved, because someone has to be

This point is taken even further as he sings a song from the Oklahoma musical that is originally sang by Jud, an unloved villain in a love triangle.


Just before dying, Jake delivers a speech inspired by John Nash's final speech from A Beautiful Mind
Ans that's Jake's way to break free from the guilt and the shame he's been feeling throughout his life


Shame is a concept that is emphasised several times in the movie, he doesn't let his girlfriend go down to the basement which symbolizes shame for him
It is also shown just before his breakdown when he remembers his parents fighting



I'm thinking of ending things is a very deep, thought through movie that needs to be seen twice to appreciate all the work and details put into it.



At the end I'd like to say that this is our own interpretation based on only watching the movie, and not reading the book

In fact, I think the fact that I love it so much may be why I never warmed to Control.

while more mainstream is one of the best horror mystery who dunnits of the 2000s.  leaving las vegas is something to watch when your depressed and just want to watch someone completly destroy

It's about multiple generations of musicians as things progress across the 20th Century.  I'm always kind of surprised when people haven't seen this.  It's underrated.\n\n[Bound For Glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNled6wh18c) is a biopic, but, hey, David Carradine as Woody Guthrie.  I'm surprised there isn't more enthusiasm for this one.\n\nThere's [Eddie and the Cruisers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nXj8RkP7xQ), one of my favorite films of the early 80s.  They used to show it all the time, but now you rarely see it.  It's about a larger-than-life rock personality whose absence haunts his old band members.\n\nIf you're willing to go balls to the wall Michael Pare, there's also the really kinda wonderful [Streets of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEOvn2IaLMM).\n\n[Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YUkMUE4d14), the Monkees film is worth seeing even if you're not a huge fan of The Monkees.  More dada than psychedelic.\n\n[200 Motels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7eUWh9sI7k) is not for everyone, but it's maximum Frank Zappa.\n\n[The Blues Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HCR4c1zPyk) is a crowd-pleaser.  Of all of the movies from that original SNL cast, this is probably the best.  About two guys who are getting the band back together...on a Mission From God.\n\nMore difficult to find, but quite strange, is:\n\n[Angel, Angel, Down We Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMSYYBMljQU) from 1969, and a movie that probably only could have been made in 1969.\n\n[Psych-Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0EIKC0YbyE) from a year earlier is a fairly ridiculous film about a Haight-Ashbury band called Mumblin' Jim, with Jack Nicholson as a hippie.  Famous performance of Incense and Peppermints from The Strawberry Alarm Clock.\n\nOf all the documentaries about bands ever made, the best American one I've seen is [Instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCllLHj8D_k), about the DC postpunk band, Fugazi.  Even if you know nothing about Fugazi, or don't like Fugazi, director Jem Cohen does this probably better than anyone else.  This is the kind of documentary that could make a person into a fan.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Coen Brothers - [Inside Llewyn Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFphYRyH7wc) takes place in the early 1960s Greenwich Village folk scene.  Oscar Isaac, a pretty great actor, plays the fictional Llewyn Davis, a folk musician looking to make it by his own rules.\n\n**BRITAIN**, a place I've never been but occupies 50% of my brain anyway because they are relentless in cranking out creative works that matter, has predictably also turned out some great movies involving music scenes and the like:\n\n[24 Hour Party People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFiyEegpKUM) is one of the greatest movies about music ever made.  This isn't really a biopic in the sense you mean.  It's a dramatized retelling of the story of the scene that spawned bands like Joy Division and the Happy Mondays.\n\nTrashed by critics but I didn't think it was so bad, [Northern Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6voUGHSo5I) was particularly interesting because the scene featured a lot of American soul musicians, yet had no corresponding subculture in the US: it was an entirely British scene.  It's one of the more interesting fusions of two lands.\n\nHow about...\n\n[Quadrophenia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxcW23nWho).  This movie worked in ways that Tommy didn't.  A great film about youth, disillusionment, with The Who's blistering soundtrack and Pete Townshend's creative hand.  \n\n[Tommy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K_9WyQCgA).\n\nTommy is way more over the top, but Quadrophenia is a better film by far (at least so far as I'm concerned.)  Of all of the great concept albums in rock history, Tommy is the one that most baffles me and is detached from my experience.  Still, Ken Russel directs, and there are really interesting performances/parts by Tina Turner, Elton John, and others.  The most bizarre moment is watching Jack Nicholson show up and start singing.  This film is pure spectacle.\n\nAnd\n\n[Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn99sY-PdtU), the Beatles film.  Not a great film, but, it feels like a movie any music fan should see.  The Beatles play themselves in a fictionalized and bizarre story about themselves.\n\nAnd\n\n[A Hard Day's Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWbiVqlSMgc).  Not a big early Beatles fan but it seems like people oughta...\n\nThere is a really good biopic about Joy Division's Ian Curtis, called [Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p15-hIIACvY).  Definitely one of the better biopics out there.  If you're going to watch just one, this is not a bad choice."", 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.']",29

(seriously, it\'s great).\n\n[Bloodsucking Bastards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487994/) - Basically Office Space plus vampires.  Absolutely great.\n\n[Bubba Ho-tep](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/) - Bruce Campbell plays an elderly Elvis who fights an evil mummy.  It\'s a B movie classic.\n\n[Cockneys vs Zombies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1362058/) - We all thought this was going to be terrible, but it was great fun.  Has one of the best chase scenes ever.\n\n[Cooties](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2490326/) - Infected chicken nuggets turn kids into zombies.  Elijah Wood and Rainn Wilson play brilliantly off each other. \n\n[Dance of the Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926063/) - Well done zombie apocalypse at a high school prom.\n\n[The Dead Don’t Die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8695030/) - Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tom Waits, &amp;  a bunch of other top actors star in the small town zombie flick.\n\n[George\'s Intervention](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1310641/) is a zero budget zombie film that is just plain great.  Its low budget shows through in a lot of ways, but every one of us that watched it loved it.\n\n[Juan of the Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838571/) - Brilliant zombie horror comedy.  Follows a couple of Cuban grifters who look to make money during the zombie apocalypse\n\n[Netherbeast Incorporated](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787495/) - I\'ll just quote the tag line, because any more will ruin the phenomenal first scene: ""A quirky twist on the vampire tale, set in modern day corporate America.""  Highly recommend you watch this one after Bloodsucking Bastards, although not immediately after.\n\n[Ninjas vs Zombies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1290099/) - low budget and cheesy, but very fun and good enough to have two sequels with increasing budgets\n\n[Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462485/) - Troma does zombies.  It is everything you\'d expect, both good and bad.\n\n[Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098412/) - A bunch of hillbilly vampires just want to be left alone to drink their fake blood in peace.  Bruce Campbell and David Carradine star in this campy vampire flick.\n\n[Warm Bodies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588173) - Zombie/human romance/adventure where a girl is saved by a zombie and falls in love with him.  They then try to save the world.\n\n[Zombeavers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2784512/) - Well done and original take on the ""college students trapped in a remote cabin by zombies"" trope.  In spite of the cheesy name, it is excellent.\n\n[Zombie Honeymoon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399934/) - Award winning zombie comedy film.\n\n[Zombie Shark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4704918) - the first encounter with the shark is *amazing*.

This movie is sexualising 11 year olds so the logic is that the only thing standing in between a Pedo movement legitimising this type of media is a budget and some production value.

Pretty much ANYTHING but what they ended up doing could fall under artistic exploration. \n\nI'm surprised that the feminist movement isn't more against these RnB/Hip Hop misogynistic music and dance. It over sexualizes women and in turn it's consumers/fans which are a lot fo the time children and it's really unhealthy for little girls to have role models like Cardi B and the like who only sing about using their bodies to entertain and get money from men with they bodies. It's mind boggling and it's definitely worth exploring in an artistic forum but literally showing these 11 year olds in these sexual dances is IMO one of the most tone death ways to express the art since you are exploring the subject and actually exploiting and sexualising little girls, not someone portraying an 11 year old. \n\nBy this directors logic a real pedo could use this movie as a defence and say he's a misunderstood artist trying to make an artistic exploratory movie about the sexualization of minors. Cause that is basically what this director did with Cuties, soft core porn with a big budget disguised as art with some backstory. If we allow this type of movie to exist we are basically saying that the only thing standing in between a pedo and great cover story for their soft core CP is apparently production value."", 'What’s it about', 'Yeah, get an 18/19 year old to play a 14 year old like they did in Stranger Things.', 'And that\'s a valid point and one that deserves real discussion.

I only just became aware of this film the other day and haven\'t looked into it because I\'m one of those people who wouldn\'t be able to take it. \n\nBut I think that the framework with which we discuss it needs to be ""Does the end result of critiquing this social phenomenon through exaggerating it to the point of making everyone with a soul uncomfortable justify the cost of said technique?"" \n\nAnd you\'re right that there is a cost. \n\nAnd there\'s a valid argument either way. And yeah, no matter what you do, people are gonna misinterpret it. That\'s just a reality. In a case like this, you\'re going to get a lot of the exact wrong type of audience. \n\nIn the end, it\'s a complicated debate that I feel like is getting radically oversimplified or altogether ignored in some cases. The depiction vs. glorification issue is really complex, and my point is more or less that we\'ve seen it as acceptable to depict things that most sensible people consider to be bad when it is artistically valid to do so. Framing matters, of course, but it kinda goes back all the way to Truffaut\'s whole war film dilemma - is it possible to make a truly anti-war film, since even a really nasty and horrible portrayal of war can wind up looking exciting when viewed through the lens of the camera. I feel like this kind of boils down to the same question, just about a very different subject. And I don\'t really have a good answer.

However, Doucouré uses these uncomfortable images to provoke a serious conversation about the sexualization of girls—especially regarding girls of color, the policing of a girl’s sexuality, double standards, the effect of social media on kids, and how children learn these behaviors.\n\nThe idea that ""a film cannot depict something without glorifying it"" is a concept as old as narrative filmmaking. Calling it simply one thing or the other is intellectually dishonest. *Even if* you\'re going to wildly praise it, you *must* acknowledge that it pushed (and inarguably crosses, arguably for good purpose) some lines.

I'm in a rural Japan/Korea mood at the moment and finished watching **Spring**, [Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/)**.**

**What other movies would you recommend taking place in a small village or in nature ?**

Something like Memories of Murder would also qualify, technically

There are hundreds of movies which are far beyond this stereotype, and some are beyond any country film Industry. I would recommend Ratsasan as the no. 1 movie to watch to start watching Indian cinema. A suspense thriller after watching which you will ask yourself the reason it wasn't sent for Oscar 24×7. The second movie would be Raman Raghav 2.0, filled with stellar performances and marvellous acting, with a philosophy that not everybody is capable of understanding. Then, I would recommend Gangs Of Wasseypur Part I and Part II. I don't have a single word for both of these movies, I have never witnessed this level of acting skills, comedy, action, character development and most important perfectly timed music ever in my life. The screenplay, the storyline and the performances are far beyond the stereotype. There a few more movies such as Anjaam Pathira, Penguin (Amazon Prime Original), Lucia, Aamis, Chhichhore (this is the only movie which is not as dark and gory as the other movies I mentioned, and just a masterpiece based on Indian hostel and college life) and Sonchiriya.",My first post here.,"['Oh okay, I am sorry for that.', ""I've removed the post because you should only suggest one movie at a time.\n\nMake sure to read our [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/8iamsh) before posting :)""]",2

Im describing this pretty poorly, but i really love this when it happens in zombie movies, the idea of scavenging all of the regular food you eat now from your neighbours abandoned houses etc. Everything is still super fresh so there is no new order or force. No farms or organisation that has considerably brought stuff back together.

Just watched #Alive which was decent for it, but seriously i just enjoy it so much in movies would love more, its most prevalent in zombie movies but im happy for any that use it.

E.g. i really liked the early episodes of The Walking Dead, but kind of lose interest once stuff begins to collate back into grungy towns. I love that crazy no rules of society but super strong shadow of it, its almost a bit magical ignoring the shittiness of it, like something a kid would dream up.","Movies where the main character is living a very unusual solitary life, because of societal collapse?","['I Am Mother', ""*^(Replying after taking permission from mod)* \n\nIn the comments on this post I found these movies available to stream and here are the details which can help you decide tonight's movie faster - \n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Title**|**IMDb**|**Rotten Tomatoes**|**Metacritic**|**Where to watch**|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|[I Am Legend (2007)](https://www.google.com/search?q=I+Am+Legend+2007)|[7.2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/)|[70%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/770669778)|65|[Fubotv](https://link.fubo.tv/al1%3Fv%3D1%26a%3Dplay%26t%3Dprogram%26pid%3DMV002001050000%26o%3D0&amp;irmp=1206980&amp;irad=599309)|\n|[Zombieland (2009)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Zombieland+2009)|[7.6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/)|[90%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/770802740)|73|[Fubotv](https://link.fubo.tv/al1%3Fv%3D1%26a%3Dplay%26t%3Dprogram%26pid%3DMV002510450000%26o%3D0&amp;irmp=1206980&amp;irad=599309)|\n|[A Quiet Place (2018)](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Quiet+Place+2018)|[7.5](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6644200/)||82|[Amazon Prime Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/A-Quiet-Place-VG56SnNMVDdhR1JHYVNFbXFBVkFZQT09) [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/dd89e42d-56b8-497e-b108-bbc0ac89c82f)|\n|[Dawn Of The Dead (2004)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Dawn+Of+The+Dead+2004)|[7.3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/)|[75%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/17051)|59|[Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/Dawn-of-the-Dead-QW5pL1laVFE0TjNtN2xpLzRCcWltZz09) [Showtime Amazon Channel](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Showtime](https://www.showtime.com/#/movie/3463344)|\n|[Z For Zachariah (2015)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Z+For+Zachariah+2015)|[6.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598642/)|[80%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771408592)|68|[Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/Z-for-Zachariah-bGZXVDJTYkNDS2NJZHV2UnZCNEJ6QT09)|\n|[The Survivalist (2015)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Survivalist+2015)|[6.4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2580382/)|[97%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771432596)|80|[Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/The-Survivalist/862894) [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/the-survivalist/8d6kgwxd2h8w?ct=movie)|\n|[Collapse (2009)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Collapse+2009)|[7.8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1503769/)|[83%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/770757997)|71|[Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Collapse/180509) [Amazon Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Google Play Movies](https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Collapse?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=uxWpxQXMcp4)|\n|[Our Home (2010)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Our+Home+2010)|[6.4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467388/)|||[Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11903893)|\n|[The Road (2011)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Road+2011)|[5.6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2063008/)|[67%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771258122)|71|[Amazon Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail)|\n|[The Walking Dead (1995)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Walking+Dead+1995)|[4.8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114888/)|||[Directv](https://www.directv.com/movies/The-Walking-Dead-S0JwZFIzMzljT3p6TkcrOWttSDVNZz09)|\n|[The Apocalypse (1997)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Apocalypse+1997)|[4.4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118631/)|||[Amazon Prime Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Tubi Tv](https://tubitv.com/movies/492793?utm_source=justwatch-feed&amp;tracking=justwatch-feed)|\n|[The Umbrella (2016)](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Umbrella+2016)|[7.6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215655/)|||[Amazon Prime Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail) [Tubi Tv](https://tubitv.com/movies/446854?utm_source=justwatch-feed&amp;tracking=justwatch-feed)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nP.S. - You can help me predict movie names better by putting names between quotes while commenting. \n\n[PM the Creator](https://www.reddit.com/user/yzalthree)"", 'The Mad Max series might be interesting for you if you haven’t already seen', 'Part of The Umbrella Academy series', ""This is what I loved about Dawn of the Dead (1978).

Now, while I have seen a fair chunk of movies of that genre and have a general direction/inspiration to draw from, I'm at a point where more input might not be a bad thing. So I'm looking for movies that you people like that go in that adventure movie type direction like the ones I mentioned above. (Also stuff like Lord of the Rings or Jurassic Park which aren't primarily Adventure movies but definitely have some common ground) Alternatively, I'm also open to movies regarding the themes I want to talk about. Perhaps you even know of any adventure movies that already have these themes in them which would be massively helpful. 
Are there any movies you could suggest me that might fit this description? I'd be very grateful for anything you can think of. 
Thank you, kind people of reddit :)

Shortround never bothered me but he bothers some people. It's really just Willie and all the bad comedy with her character. Raiders didn't have much bad comedy. Also, the sacred stones doesn't quite have the mystic of the Ark of the Covenant, but the Thugee cult is pretty cool. \n\nIncidentally, the Thugee cult in Temple of Doom is lifted directly from Gunga Din, which is why I recommended it."", 'Yep, a hard agree on... I think her name was... Willie? She is easily the most annoying of all the love interests Indy gets and Marion is easily the best. If they changed those two out I\'d probably even go so far as to say Temple of Doom is my favorite movie of all time.\n\nWhat sways my mind into preferring Temple over Raiders (very marginally, I might add, as per your analysis with which I 100% agree) is, as I said, the bonkers dark magic, heart-stealing, child enslaving, over-the-top pure evilness of the cultists against some ""generic"" Nazis (but I do like Belloq more then Mola Ram who had basically no personality at all) with the Ark, which I personally think isn\'t very interesting or original, and the sidekicks.\n\nI just love Short Round, he, for me, is easily the most fun sidekick and has way more of a personality then Sallah. Indys dad is fine and it gives Indy a great human side to explore and I think it was the perfect choice to take the story in that direction, I just, unfortunately, am not that big of a Connery fan and Henry Sr. as a character is just a little bit too unlikable in general to contend with the others. \n\nAnd yeah, Crystal Skull really was very poorly executed and it\'s a shame because there was a good movie hidden underneath loads and loads of unnecessary crap and bad effects and very strange character and plotting choices. And also, oh yes, that  climax is just... pathetic.\n\nAll in all though, I think, you can\'t go wrong with any of the original trilogy. They are all solid films in their own right and work perfectly together to paint Indy as the icon he is still remembered as today and I love them all. Fingers crossed Indy 5 will actually return the franchise to its strengths for one last awesome swan song.', ""Well, that's a hot take. I'd say Raiders easily surpasses all of them, not just for creating the character (and practically the entire genre) but for just having a better story and incredibly solid action sequences and a great love interest.\n\nHowever, I love Temple of Doom, and it would be the best if the Kate Capshaw character weren't so poorly handled. She really damages the film. \n\nI'm not a fan of Last Crusade, which seems to be the reigning favorite today. Yes, the Ford/Connery relationship is great, but the other characters are abysmal, esp. the female (and they ruined Denholm Elliot's character). Aside from the awesome tank battle, it's mostly Indie vs. special effects, some of them really poorly done, so it doesn't even deliver the action, which is the whole point of watching an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nCrystal Skull has some great ideas, but terrible execution, unmemorable action scenes, too many nods to the previous films, some really stupid stuff, and most importantly, a nothing climax. \n\nBut yes, you should take a modern approach, but you should also take whatever good ideas you can from the past, and not retread tired ideas that have already been done."", ""Thanks, that's super helpful and I will check your list. I agree, the original trilogy is just a freaking masterclass and got me, together with JP (another Spielberg) and LOTR, into loving movies so much. Having some of those overlap into action isn't a problem, in fact, I love the Action-Adventure genre probably most of all genres.\nI'll also definitely check out The Wind and the Lion, if I can find it streaming somewhere."", 'Welp, hot take but I actually think Raiders might be the worst of the Indy Trilogy. And an even hotter take, I think Temple of Doom is better than the Last Crusade (objectively I may be very wrong and I\'m aware of that, I just prefer the darker tone and the otherworldly, crazy things in Temple over the religious stuff in the other movies). Hottest take might be, that I think, conceptually, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is more interesting then Raiders and Last Crusade. \n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I totally agree with you, knowing where it all started and what the big and ""great"" ones of my generation took for inspiration is an absolute necessity, so I will definitely seek them out. The ideas, themes and sheer artistry they display are practically unmatched in today\'s homogeneous run-of-the-mill movie landscape. But, in my opinion, these movies aren\'t ""state of the art"" anymore (hate that expression but couldn\'t think of anything better) and unfortunately I think most of the movies from that time period, that I\'ve seen, have some pretty difficult approaches to Storytelling that I don\'t necessarily agree with. Again, I do actually agree with you, that I should know them, and I will go watch them, it\'s just that I (obviously) want to take a more modern approach to the kind of story I want to tell.', ""I have a list on IMDb of my favorite adventure films that has 68 titles so far. [It can be viewed here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047468732/). It starts out with the original Indiana Jones trilogy (the gold standard of cinematic entertainment, as far as I'm concerned) and goes into the original Star Wars trilogy. Many of the movies on the list overlap with the action genre (though not all do).\n\nIf you're looking for a masterful swashbuckler, I'd recommend *The Wind and the Lion* (1975; it's on the list), which is very, very, very, very, very, very loosely based on a hostage crisis that took place in 1904 Morocco."", ""well, if you want to emulate Raiders of the Lost Ark, you need to know where Raiders came from, since they were very much emulating the adventure films of their childhood. Same with Pirates of the Caribbean, which is based on a ride from 1967 that was emulating the pirate movies of yore.\n\nI'd also throw in the first two Weissmuller Tarzans - Tarzan the Ape Man and Tarzan and His Mate."", 'Ah, yes, the classics. I have to admit I\'m probably a little too young/""impatient""/fast-paced (however you want to call it) for most of these to fully appreciate them but the ones of those I have seen (Treasure Island and Mark of Zorro) were definitely very enjoyable and had a huge influence on me.\nAlso, I\'m always down for some more obscure/unkown titles. I have heard from Aguirre, at least, so I\'m very excited to go through it and the rest of your suggestions.', ""I don't know it but I'm sure to give it a look if I can find it."", 'some relevant classics you should probably know:\n\n* Gunga Din (1939)\n* The Sea Hawk (1940)\n* Treasure Island (1950)\n* Douglas Fairbanks films (Black Pirate, Thief of Bagdad, Mark of Zorro)\n\nand more obscure adventure films to seek out:\n\n* Nate and Hayes\n* Aguirre: Wrath of God\n* Sorcerer\n* Mountains of the Moon', 'The Beach', ""Oh yeah, a classic, perfect feel-good adventure movie. I totally forgot about this one, so it's definitely due a rewatch for this project."", 'Thanks, yeah it looks like a pretty fun movie, I hope I can find it on stream somewhere (Germany). Spielberg also just is the king regarding these kinds of movies for me.', 'The Goonies (1985)', 'Ready Player One is a great adventure movie.

The others I will thoroughly analyze, especially their respective scripts."", ""The PJ King Kong is awesome and a hard yes, although I feel like the movie loses its focus as soon as they leave the Island.\nThe original Jumanji is also pretty fun, I haven't seen the reboot yet, but I've heard mostly positive things so maybe I'll watch it over the weekend."", 'The adventures of Tintin: The secret of the unicorn', 'Apocalypse Now\n\nThe Revenant\n\nApocalypto\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Jumanji \nKing kong']",26

Didn't read the prequels, though. Why would you think no one here reads?\n\n&gt; But why the need to “prepare” yourself for a movie?\n\nThis I agree with. Sounds like movie homework.\n\n&gt; It looks sick from the trailer\n\nMaybe if you'd read the books, you'd have higher expectations."", ""Yeah, you're right, it's the packaging. I never watch trailers because they're shit, but here I was curious.\n\nAbout prejudging it, I don't know how much space there is for hope. The glimpses from the trailer left a sour impression. I'll give them one thing, they seem to be diving deep into the meat of the court intrigue between the houses. But Dune's premise is the inception of myth, it's much grander than that. The main actor doesn't seem to have enough weight to carry that role. He seems like a sulky, spoiled American teenager. While Paul was in the process of growing up and facing his fate, it was much more subtle and there was more depth.\n\nAlso, the cinematography of the movie tends towards grey. Usually this is the sign that there'll be a lot of cheap CGI moving parts, because they're easier to mesh into an overall greyish composition. Cheap doesn't necessarily mean bad, it just means an overwhelming amount of it that sucks the soul out of a movie. To me, Dune is a place of vibrant color, of golden sands and searing sunlight, of bright blue Fremen eyes. I don't want to watch it mashed down to a boring grey.  \n\nIf we actually get an amazing Dune movie, I'll gladly eat my words. No one would be happier than me. I've reread the books and rewatched the existing movies many times. It's been with me for almost three decades. But I'm not holding my breath."", 'No', 'Im waiting for new one', ""While I love the 1984 Dune version, one big problem is that many of the scenes are incredibly visually dark - you can't see anything.\n\nAs for not wanting to read books - have you tried recorded books? They have been a game changer for many people who don't like to read. Just listen when you are in the car or on public transport or hanging out. \n\nI'll tell you that the books are wonderful. Frank Herbert created an incredible universe and you'll miss all that if you just watch the movies."", ""Just read the book.  I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to if you're interested in the movie.  I really liked the book when I was in my teens but re-reading it a few years ago, I didn't get into it as much. Many of its ideas have been used in other things such as the awful *Avatar*.  The Lynch movie is good as a Lynch movie and okay as a summary of the book.  It has a lot of fun, surreal things going on and feels at times like it's an absurd version of some *Star Wars* stuff."", 'No. Read the book, or if you can’t, at least watch book guides/summaries on youtube.', ""Yeah I mean if you come in with mixed expectations you just might like it more than you thought. The bad guys, the Harkonnen, are the best thing about it. They are so disgusting, weird and vulgar, their set designs are great. Otherwise the story is a pretty generic chosen one narrative, which I'm sure the new one will be as well."", 'yaaasss the lego forcefields!', ""Yes. It is an amazing movie. personal GOAT. don't @ me."", ""All of this is valid, but perhaps we are judging it too early, the music? For all we know, it's not even Hans Zimmer in the trailer. That's right, Zimmer is scoring Dune. Hollywood generally uses third party music for promotional material. After all, Denis Villaneuve did not put that trailer together, it was a marketing company. Very lousy trailer in my opinion. I really was hyped for a unique approach to marketing, something groundbreaking for marketing just like how the movie is going to be to the Industry, hopefully. Here's to hope!"", ""Please consider Jodorowsky's Dune instead because Lynch used most of Jodorowsky's ideas and it would be a great introduction to AJs films.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/m0cJNR8HEw0\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky's_Dune"", 'I doubt anyone here actually read the books, myself included.

You can definitely see the age with some special effects. But it is not terrible.', ""For comparison, here's some themes from Dune (1984):\n\n[Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsQQTiiVzw)\n\n[Prophecy Theme\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4onBqilHvc)\n\nSoundtrack from [Children of Dune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtcnt_VkvGU&amp;list=PLAA2B93987C16DBB9&amp;index=1) was equally majestic.\n\nAlthough, Dune (1984) had the unfortunate ending theme by Toto that did not fit the movie at all. \n\nCompare that Prologue theme to this shit from the[ 2020 movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OB1oq_tAio). It just doesn't hold up. Nods to Pink Floyd and all."", ""Yes, with caveats.  The score and production design are sumptuous.  Kyle MacLachlan's central performance is great.\n\nAs a fan of the book, it's not a great adaptation, but still has some great moments. And it's not a great Lynch movie either, though it definite has some of his signature style.\n\nI recommend it mostly as a historical artifact.  It's also fun to think that Lynch was in negotiations to direct The Return of the Jedi and quit to work on this project, where he was promised more control"", ""It's not as bad as people make it out to be. I definitely enjoyed it, but be warned that it suffers from bad structure and a cartoony villain. On the other hand, it has great atmosphere and decent design. If you have, read the books you will find it subpar. If you haven't, you will have a good time."", 'Well, if you say you dont really read books, Dune its not the best starter for you.

In the books, there was no device.', ""Ok... So... The books go WAY further in detail with some of the more interesting parts of the world and what's happening.

I can’t stress that enough', 'I will watch and love anything with Patrick Stewart in it.', ""As other posters mentioned, the book really is incredible. Theres some good background on the story in the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune. It gives some great insight into why it's been such a phenomenally difficult franchise to bring to screen"", 'Then watch the movie.\n\nAlso if you keep going, you can stop at God Emperor (unless you really want to keep going).', 'Some very cool visual concepts in it. I really liked the  shields.', 'agreed. didnt know that, but not surprised', 'Audiobooks are always an option. Far more accessible than the book.', 'I’d recommend it', 'Watch the miniseries instead: Frank Herbert\'s Dune (2000) and Frank Herbert\'s Children of Dune (2003).\n\n The CGI is a bit weak, but the storytelling, the acting and the all-in-all Dune ""feeling"" is just perfect. It\'s far more accurate to the source material than the Lynch version.', ""I'm not very high-brow, but I've watched it a few times over the years and have enjoyed it each time.  I find the cinematography  allows the characters to really express themself, even if a few do go a bit too far."", 'As a version of the book it is a bit of a fail, particularly the ending. Still I think it is a very underrated film and would even go as far to say it is a classic in its own way.', ""it rains at the end of the 1984 movie -which doesn't happen for  another  couple of books. But it does has Sting in a  blue bikini bottom as Feyd Ruatha"", ""The 1984 movie is imperfect, confusing and diverges from the books in some ways. It has aspects that haven't aged well. However, it manages to convey the monumental, enormous and mythical sense of the books. It gives Arrakis the alien grandeur it deserves. \n\nThen there was the miniseries that was more straightforward and followed the books more closely. It was decent but lacked all the mythical grandeur of the Lynch movie. The miniseries adaptation of Children of Dune was fairly good. None of them are as memorable and striking as the 1984 movie.\n\nI agree with the other poster, the new trailer looks like yet another bland and sanitized blockbuster. What shocked me the most about it was the music, it was so bad compared to the Lynch movie. It had nothing of the mystique. It's going to be yet another greyed-to-fuck CGI monstrosity.\n\nIf you want to experience Dune in truth, read the books. They are incredible, multilayered and multifaceted, immersion in a world on a much grander scale than ours."", ""Not really. It's a confusing mess. The 2020 one will be the same story, you don't have to see the old ones to understand this one. I'd say read the book in preparation instead of watching the old movies."", ""i think it's fantastic, and if you look you can find the long version. the new one looks so bland and blockbuster-y to me."", 'Hell yeah, it’s got Kyle McLaughlin, Patrick Stewart, Sting, sandworms and lego forcefeilds.', 'Read the book.', ""Lynch isn't happy with the film as it's nothing close to what he wanted to make. It's not very 'Lynchian'. I still think it's an enjoyable film though."", 'Is that the one with Kyle machlalan in it? Then a hearty yes!!', ""lol :D\n\nsure, I'd recommend it."", ""I'm not sure I'd agree there.  I found *The Lord Of The Rings* to be much more a laborious read."", ""Yes, the Lynch *Dune* is worth the watch.  You have people like Patrick Stewart and Brad Dourif and even Sting popping up in the film, it's got some unforgettable scenes, and all of it's wrapped up in a movie soundtrack by the rock group Toto.  DEFINITELY worth your time!"", ""I agree with you, bang on with the main actor point. I also was expecting vibrant colours and breathtaking landscapes, given the legacy of the book and the track record of the director. There were some insider reports saying that the sets built for this were magnificent. I have not read Dune, I have seen Denis' older movies. But I pray that this is our generation's Star Wars. I wasn't around for the first one."", 'High five to another sci-fi fan. :)', 'Hi there I didn’t mean for it to come out that way, I meant not everyone read the Dune book series, but if you do, good for you. I just got the bandwagoning vibes from OP and I’m just telling it for what it is. \n\nAgreed I’d be more hyped if I knew about the Dune series before the trailer came out, but it doesn’t matter because I’m a sci-fi fan and a movie fan so I’m going to watch it anyway.', 'yea - his name is a weapon, or something.  and lets not even start withe intro by the princess -appearing and disappearing  in a background of stars.', ""It would be a bit like preparing for The Dark Knight watching the 1966 TV Batman show...

Sting in a Speedo !!!', ""The visuals and acting are top-notch, the world building's at least decent, even by modern standards, maybe a cut above that.\n\nThe story line is unfortunately rendered crude.  It doesn't start really hurting until the end, though, so watch it until it gets unwatchable?"", ""To prepare for the new Dune, I think you'd be better off listening to the audio book and then maybe watching the 1984 movie after if you want.

I never watch trailers because they're shit, but here I was curious.\n\nAbout prejudging it, I don't know how much space there is for hope. The glimpses from the trailer left a sour impression. I'll give them one thing, they seem to be diving deep into the meat of the court intrigue between the houses. But Dune's premise is the inception of myth, it's much grander than that. The main actor doesn't seem to have enough weight to carry that role. He seems like a sulky, spoiled American teenager. While Paul was in the process of growing up and facing his fate, it was much more subtle and there was more depth.\n\nAlso, the cinematography of the movie tends towards grey. Usually this is the sign that there'll be a lot of cheap CGI moving parts, because they're easier to mesh into an overall greyish composition. Cheap doesn't necessarily mean bad, it just means an overwhelming amount of it that sucks the soul out of a movie. To me, Dune is a place of vibrant color, of golden sands and searing sunlight, of bright blue Fremen eyes. I don't want to watch it mashed down to a boring grey.  \n\nIf we actually get an amazing Dune movie, I'll gladly eat my words. No one would be happier than me. I've reread the books and rewatched the existing movies many times. It's been with me for almost three decades. But I'm not holding my breath."", 'No', 'Im waiting for new one', ""While I love the 1984 Dune version, one big problem is that many of the scenes are incredibly visually dark - you can't see anything.\n\nAs for not wanting to read books - have you tried recorded books? They have been a game changer for many people who don't like to read. Just listen when you are in the car or on public transport or hanging out. \n\nI'll tell you that the books are wonderful. Frank Herbert created an incredible universe and you'll miss all that if you just watch the movies."", ""Just read the book.  I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to if you're interested in the movie.  I really liked the book when I was in my teens but re-reading it a few years ago, I didn't get into it as much. Many of its ideas have been used in other things such as the awful *Avatar*.  The Lynch movie is good as a Lynch movie and okay as a summary of the book.  It has a lot of fun, surreal things going on and feels at times like it's an absurd version of some *Star Wars* stuff."", 'No. Read the book, or if you can’t, at least watch book guides/summaries on youtube.', ""Yeah I mean if you come in with mixed expectations you just might like it more than you thought. The bad guys, the Harkonnen, are the best thing about it. They are so disgusting, weird and vulgar, their set designs are great. Otherwise the story is a pretty generic chosen one narrative, which I'm sure the new one will be as well."", 'yaaasss the lego forcefields!', ""Yes. It is an amazing movie. personal GOAT. don't @ me."", ""All of this is valid, but perhaps we are judging it too early, the music? For all we know, it's not even Hans Zimmer in the trailer. That's right, Zimmer is scoring Dune. Hollywood generally uses third party music for promotional material. After all, Denis Villaneuve did not put that trailer together, it was a marketing company. Very lousy trailer in my opinion. I really was hyped for a unique approach to marketing, something groundbreaking for marketing just like how the movie is going to be to the Industry, hopefully. Here's to hope!"", ""Please consider Jodorowsky's Dune instead because Lynch used most of Jodorowsky's ideas and it would be a great introduction to AJs films.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/m0cJNR8HEw0\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky's_Dune"", 'I doubt anyone here actually read the books, myself included. But why the need to “prepare” yourself for a movie? It looks sick from the trailer just wait for it to come out and watch it, you don’t have to hype yourself up just because everyone else is.', 'It is alright... You can definitely see the age with some special effects. But it is not terrible.', ""For comparison, here's some themes from Dune (1984):\n\n[Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsQQTiiVzw)\n\n[Prophecy Theme\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4onBqilHvc)\n\nSoundtrack from [Children of Dune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtcnt_VkvGU&amp;list=PLAA2B93987C16DBB9&amp;index=1) was equally majestic.\n\nAlthough, Dune (1984) had the unfortunate ending theme by Toto that did not fit the movie at all. \n\nCompare that Prologue theme to this shit from the[ 2020 movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OB1oq_tAio). It just doesn't hold up. Nods to Pink Floyd and all."", ""Yes, with caveats.  The score and production design are sumptuous.  Kyle MacLachlan's central performance is great.\n\nAs a fan of the book, it's not a great adaptation, but still has some great moments. And it's not a great Lynch movie either, though it definite has some of his signature style.\n\nI recommend it mostly as a historical artifact.  It's also fun to think that Lynch was in negotiations to direct The Return of the Jedi and quit to work on this project, where he was promised more control"", ""It's not as bad as people make it out to be. I definitely enjoyed it, but be warned that it suffers from bad structure and a cartoony villain. On the other hand, it has great atmosphere and decent design. If you have, read the books you will find it subpar. If you haven't, you will have a good time."", 'Well, if you say you dont really read books, Dune its not the best starter for you. There are 6 books in total and its not an easy read at all.', ""Why sully your palate?\n\nIf you don't want to read the book then why not go see the new film without any expectations?"", 'There was also something about the weirding modules. In the books, there was no device.', ""Ok... So... The books go WAY further in detail with some of the more interesting parts of the world and what's happening. However, the movie is definitely enjoyable and if watch it. As someone else said, it has Patrick Stewart, Sting, and sand worms!! What can go wrong?!?"", '&gt;the new one looks so bland and blockbuster-y to me.\n\nAgreed 100%.', 'I’m gonna say what someone else said. Read the book. I can’t stress that enough', 'I will watch and love anything with Patrick Stewart in it.', ""As other posters mentioned, the book really is incredible. Theres some good background on the story in the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune. It gives some great insight into why it's been such a phenomenally difficult franchise to bring to screen"", 'Then watch the movie.\n\nAlso if you keep going, you can stop at God Emperor (unless you really want to keep going).', 'Some very cool visual concepts in it. I really liked the  shields.', 'agreed. didnt know that, but not surprised', 'Audiobooks are always an option. Far more accessible than the book.', 'I’d recommend it', 'Watch the miniseries instead: Frank Herbert\'s Dune (2000) and Frank Herbert\'s Children of Dune (2003).\n\n The CGI is a bit weak, but the storytelling, the acting and the all-in-all Dune ""feeling"" is just perfect. It\'s far more accurate to the source material than the Lynch version.', ""I'm not very high-brow, but I've watched it a few times over the years and have enjoyed it each time.  I find the cinematography  allows the characters to really express themself, even if a few do go a bit too far."", 'As a version of the book it is a bit of a fail, particularly the ending. Still I think it is a very underrated film and would even go as far to say it is a classic in its own way.', ""it rains at the end of the 1984 movie -which doesn't happen for  another  couple of books. But it does has Sting in a  blue bikini bottom as Feyd Ruatha"", ""The 1984 movie is imperfect, confusing and diverges from the books in some ways. It has aspects that haven't aged well. However, it manages to convey the monumental, enormous and mythical sense of the books. It gives Arrakis the alien grandeur it deserves. \n\nThen there was the miniseries that was more straightforward and followed the books more closely. It was decent but lacked all the mythical grandeur of the Lynch movie. The miniseries adaptation of Children of Dune was fairly good. None of them are as memorable and striking as the 1984 movie.\n\nI agree with the other poster, the new trailer looks like yet another bland and sanitized blockbuster. What shocked me the most about it was the music, it was so bad compared to the Lynch movie. It had nothing of the mystique. It's going to be yet another greyed-to-fuck CGI monstrosity.\n\nIf you want to experience Dune in truth, read the books. They are incredible, multilayered and multifaceted, immersion in a world on a much grander scale than ours."", ""Not really. It's a confusing mess. The 2020 one will be the same story, you don't have to see the old ones to understand this one. I'd say read the book in preparation instead of watching the old movies."", ""i think it's fantastic, and if you look you can find the long version. the new one looks so bland and blockbuster-y to me."", 'Hell yeah, it’s got Kyle McLaughlin, Patrick Stewart, Sting, sandworms and lego forcefeilds.', 'Read the book.', ""Lynch isn't happy with the film as it's nothing close to what he wanted to make. It's not very 'Lynchian'. I still think it's an enjoyable film though."", 'Is that the one with Kyle machlalan in it? Then a hearty yes!!', ""lol :D\n\nsure, I'd recommend it.""]",112

We used to play a lot of free paintball with our friends  in the woods and in some unconventional spots (e.g., a cemetery, a construction site) when no one else was there.  \n\n Playing a lot of paintball makes you realize how unbelievably unrealistic shooting scenes in most action movies are.   \n\nIn real life for instance, 2 shooters or more will almost certainly wreck 1 lone shooter NO MATTER HOW ""good"" the lone shooter is.   It is just too easy for 1 person to lay down cover fire and the other to either flank or get an angle on the outnumbered person.   This movie shows these types of principles flawlessly.  You get to see what happens when 2 shooters face off against 5 or more (when all 7 of them know what they\'re doing) in terms of how they use cover and coordinate their attacks for instance.  \n\nThere is a lot of violence and disturbing scenes.  The ending is neither happy nor sad, just...  realistic.   And the characters will stick with you for a long time afterwards.  James Caan and Taye Diggs among others do a great job in the supporting cast.\n\nNot in my top 50 or even top 100, but certainly one of the most memorable movies you will ever see.\n\nfuck, I think i just talked myself into rewatching this tonight :)', 'The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford.', 'Slightly left field and not western but if you want something genuinely tense and filled with dread try La Haine', ""In my opinion, The Veteran (2011) has the best shooting scene I have ever seen (Yes, better than the one(s) in Heat (1995)).

And honestly, I am of the opinion that westerns shouldn't be fast, or at least should know the value of slower segments.

474,2020-09-08 09:25:31,iouhuu,request,27,"Hey there Movie Buffs!

I have been on a moviespree lately and always been a big fan of like likes of P.T. Anderson, Tarantino, Nicolas Winding Refn, Van Trier and so on.

I recently watched all Gilliam and all Cronenberg Movies. I also found a liking to very dark, slow and weird films like Mandy, The Greasy Strangler or Possessor.(Cronenberg's Son!)

I tried some classic arthouse films, but they weren't quite what I was hoping for.

Only God Forgives, The Greasy Strangler and The House that Jack Built are among my favorite movies of all time.

While we are at it, if anyone knows some slow, psychological gory movies without jumpscares (like the remake of Suspiria) hit me up! I like to adore the disturbing imagery without messy shaky cams and jumpcuts and jumpscares.

Cheers! Hoping for some nice back and forth, don't be shy! I like to try all sorts of movies.","Looking for Tons of ""Modern Arthouse"" Movies (Refn, Cronenberg P.T. Anderson, ...)","['Awesome! 3 more I have not seen, thanks amigo!', 'Man, I have seen so many things over the years, I could have listed so many more movies I have already seen. I am in love with Park Chan. I can\'t decide between Oldboy and Lady Vengeance, but I will never watch the remake, don\'t worry hehe!\n\nThe Handmaiden was a cool cinema experience, especially in germany where many people are still prude and were very uncomfortable during the naughty scenes xD\n\nI really dug ""I saw the Devil"" aswell!', 'I agree with you about Love, however I think it was a natural evolution for him considering his previous films.  Now that it is out of his system, the best is yet to come I think.\n\nHave you explored Park Chan-wook\'s filmography?
