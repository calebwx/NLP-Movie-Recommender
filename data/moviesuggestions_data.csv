I dont know if theres any but basically Im looking for movies in which the main character would preferably be a man that suffers from this disorder, is extremely sensitive to any sort of rejection or failure, is reluctant to interact with anyone at all, is convinced that nobody likes him and acts accordingly by avoiding people while deeply wanting to connect to them but being unable to do so. Ultimately all this leads him to a life of isolation with very few if any friends at all or close people.

Hi Everyone. I had originally posted this on r/movies but someone suggested I post it here as well.

 I d like to tell you about my favorite movie. The Abyss. It was released in 1989 and Directed by James Cameron. I stars Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Micheal Biehn, and is supported by a very talented cast. This movie takes place almost entirely underwater as the Navy uses a cutting edge submersible oil rig to help them locate a crashed submarine in an abyss as a massive hurricane is barreling down on their location. One of the divers has an encounter with a small ""dance of light"" and tries to convince everyone that she saw an alien of some sort. The Navy SEALs that have come down to the rig to lead the mission see the encounter as a threat and automatically think it is the Russians. They take the small sub named CAB 1 to retrieve a nuclear warhead from the sub just as the crew needs it to unhook the umbilical cable that is feeding them power and oxygen. upon their return, the crew scrambles to get the umbilical disconnected but are unsuccessful because the crane on the ship crashes into the ocean and falls dangerously close to the rig and the cliff that it sits atop. The crane falls over the cliff and begins to drag the rig toward the abyss and only by sheer luck it stops before going over and falling into the depths below where it most certainly will be crushed by the pressure. During the slide, massive damage was done to the rig and many of the crew lost their lives. They are sitting on the edge and are running out of air. Now the battle to convince the SEAL team not to set off a nuclear bomb begins. Watch to find out the rest.

There are two versions the theatrical and extended versions. I of course recommend the extended version because it is a more complete move. the theatrical version had what I feel important plot points removed for the sake of time.

I have chosen the Ozark because it has four seasons and because I can watch it without scaring it to remain half.

In fact, I had some suspicious about how it would to be sustained during many seasons. Someone has lost or another one has stealed a big money and the boss wants his money. That money to be found and our hero will survive or not to be found and our smart hero to be killed. How can you long such story?

At specially in the first part I have been influenced about the being treatment of the story. It was really realistic and was arousing interest for the later.

I am about to finish the first season and I am recommending it to you. 

I am aware that lots of the Netflix serials and I think films do not inspire confidence, but the Ozark in the terms of the first season proves the otherwise.          

For sustaning the story, they are using the side relations and the thriller is always live. It shows clearly that dark money relations in county are solid and wide as much as the relation in cities. Nowhere and no one are safe.     

It has some femme fatale elements and feeds hero father and mild husband, but because we are aware the mainstram movies' story style, that is not surprising.

I hope it does not overturn in the later seasons.",See the Ozark (in Netflix)

However, I'm no linguist, but I'd imagine learning/translating a totally alien language would be next to impossible, especially in such a short span of time. Language is shaped by culture and it may not be possible to learn much of the alien language without understanding their culture and history first, especially for a written language. Even learning simple greetings would be extremely difficult since that's also entrenched in culture and history. In the movie, they taught and learned from the aliens using gestures, pictures, and movements, but I'm not sure if that's enough. At the very least it'd take years. It's a good one.

It's soul sucking, mind shattering, and cruelly dark. In other words, it was great and I highly recommend it.

The movie looks gorgeous and the dialogue was great, as you would expect from a Tarantino film.  I thought that Christopher Waltz and Jamie Foxx were great as the mismatched bounty hunter team.

The subject matter of the film (slavery) is something that really ratchets up the tension of every scene.  The movie shines a light on an extremely uncomfortable subject for Americans and brings a ton of baggage with it.  I think that uneasiness really makes the movie more captivating because you're witnessing the utter brutality of the situation mixed in with the chance for two people to escape from that reality.  You really end up very sympathetic towards Django by the end of the movie.  I don't think you'd get nearly as interesting of a movie if this were just an updated spaghetti western.

In order to combat this amalgamation of malfunctions, Shock said the medical community needs to combine resources and focus attention on finding causes rather than treating side effects. Like a leukemia patient mustering every bit of strength and technology within their means to rid themselves of cancer, the pharmaceutical industry would need to unite to put to rest this end of life mental degeneration. This book accounts the introduction of L-DOPA a dopamine antagonizer that revitalized catatonic patients to a level of youth they didn't know was within them. Before an age where 1/8 of people are on antidepressants, Dr. Sacks found the key to a healthy sustainable life is holding onto that enlightenment and continuously refining the sense of self.

Last month, I have entered in anime world and discovered one of the best visual shows in my life. It is the work of Yoshiaki Kawajiri .  I saw everything from him and  visual style with crazy good drawings of characters is just best ever!  Most of the anime from 80s-2000s kinda look better then now-days animations, in my opinion.

Things like:

 "" Ninja Scroll"",

"" Highlander: The Search For Vengeance"", 

""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""

""Redline""

Those were few examples of visual style and atmosphere I like.  I am not sure who is most responsible for this crazy good vibe in those anime besides Director Kawajiri.

So if you can help me find key people from those animations I listed above. Or if you could recommend me some similar stuff feel free to do it, because I will be grateful for life!
