I'm still not sure it's GOOD exactly, and it's stupid that you have to read the comic book (which is on the bluray, which is nice at least), but something about it just really resonated with me.

Krysta Now especially feels like a total prediction of the kind of industry the Kardashians became, and the idea of the world going crazy and feverishly spiraling toward the apocalypse during an election year felt creepily prescient to me too.
