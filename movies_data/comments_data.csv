I won't discuss it, haven't seen it either, but i just noticed that before the US-netflix-shitstorm, nobody in France here never even thought of this film in another way that a drama showing the problems of the youth (that was most of the critics we could read, in fact: ""that's really not subtle enough, the message is yelled in many ways all over the film""). That weird idea it could be made as a way to secretly excite a supposed perverted audience didn't cross our minds... And with all due respect, i have the feeling it says a lot more about US than about the film.

179,Tevesh_CKP,2,"If I had to guess, they had to do pre-vis which would be far enough in production that the director couldn't change them. Kind of disappointing to see the exact same action set pieces; it would've been nice to borrow from other source material. The series' two seasons had plenty of great set pieces to borrow from but making the pre-vis known elements would've lowered the budget.

Sanders', the director, only other project is Snowman and the Huntsman. My guess is he is brought on board of projects that he does not give a shit about the previs and is brought on board because he shoots underbudget and quickly. Considering how busy Johansson's schedule, a quick shoot is vital as she was always between Marvel projects which each take months. GitS '17 shooting schedule was three months according to Wikipedia which is fucking fast, especially if you're going to have action set pieces. So, knowing exactly what they wanted with a director who shoots fast is probably why Sanders was hired.

There are three writers, so that means there probably were closer to five writers. There's lots of revisions go uncredited, depending on how much they had to punch up. They all have IMDB pictures so they're real people instead of pseudonyms. These three writers haven't worked on anything together; so my guess is there was a lot of hand offs. If you make a certain number of revisions that make it to the shooting script, the writer's name needs to be recognized. Who knows how many of them worked on the script for how long and then handed it off as they got new projects?

My guess is that Krueger wrote this storyline, as he has the most property adaptation in his experience. Moss probably stuck onto the project for awhile as he doesn't have too many credits. That or he's a script doctor who is brought on to fix a page or three so while his resume looks sparse, he could be a big deal troubleshooter. Wheeler, I can't make any educated guesses towards. Consulting Producer on Roy Donovan makes me think he might be another troubleshooter.

My guess is Moss was brought for the skeleton, Kruger to adapt and Wheeler to polish a turd. The point is, if you've got a strong script, you don't need so many obvious hands mucking it up. I get immediately suspicious of any product that has more than two writers unless they work together a lot and after looking at the production with my speculation, it is no wonder GitS was a soulless mess. I watched it on the off-chance it could bring something new and interesting or be a very faithful adaptation of the first movie - it failed on both counts.",False,1600655557,g6263dw,t1_g623cst,t3_iwbq1k,False

357,jupiterkansas,1,"You're making all kinds of very wrong assumptions about me. 

It's well known that A Face in the Crowd is based on Will Rogers. 

&gt;“Arkansas Traveler” and ultimately *Crowd* originated in an  exchange between Schulberg and Will Rogers, Jr., son of the entertainer  and down-home wit. Schulberg was talking about his father, prompting  Rogers – who was then running for congress on the strength of his famous  name – to exclaim, “My father was so full of shit, because he pretends  he’s just one of the people, just one of the guys … but in our house the  only people that ever came as guests were the richest people in town,  the bankers and the power-brokers of L.A. And those were his friends and  that’s where his heart is and he \[was\] really a goddamned reactionary.”  The conversation lodged in Schulberg’s memory, eventually morphing into  the rise-and-fall story of hillbilly folksinger/TV star/quasi-fascist  demagogue Lonesome Rhodes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The successes of Arthur Godfrey and Tennessee Ernie Ford were also acknowledged in the screenplay.  

I'm not trying to denigrate Rogers. I'm just saying he was a populist entertainer who wielded political influence in much the same way. And yes, I'm not an idiot. I know he worked in radio and stage. There was no television. A Face in the Crowd is about television.

Bradley Cooper was a politician and social climber, bu he was also a clean cop who cared about doing his job right. Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan play very believable teenagers

The characters in Devil are flat and one-dimensional. Jason Clarke is just a gross, sweaty pervert. No insight into his perspective. Sebastian Stan is just a sort of stock character dirty cop. Robert Pattinson and the other religious guy both ham it up a lot, but their characters are at least a lot less boring than the others. Tom Holland has no personality aside from loving his sister. His sister has no character development, she's just a shy girl plot device

Overall, it was entertaining in moments and very boring and forgettable in others. PBTP had Derek Cianfrance, who is a legit auteur.

A detective - played by the always exceptional Koji Yakusho - who spends his off-time caring for his wife who suffers from memory issues - is on the trail, although what happens if he gets too close to this mystery person? Absolutely one of my favorite movies.

**Killer Klowns from Outer Space** it’s a b-movie, I guess, dark comedy, kinda silly in a way that’s ridiculous. It’s not really Halloween or about witches, but it’s got scary clowns. Always fun to watch in the spooky season. 

**Luna Nera**: haven’t seen it yet but it’s on my list on Netflix. Its in Italian, but it’s got dub/sub. It’s about witches in the 17th century 

**Mary and the Witch’s Flower*: on Netflix, kid-friendly animated movie, about a magic flower and a school for witches

**Apostle** I love this. It’s not witches, more like a cult but it’s great. Guy goes to rescues sister from cult on island. 

**The Wicker Man** : the classic 1973 one. It’s not about witches or Halloween but it’s got creepy vibes. A cop goes to investigate a missing girl on a remote island. Shits creepy, they got weird pagan shit with Christian stuff. 

**The Ritual** again not witches, but some weird shit. It reminded me of The VVitch or Blair Witch. Hikers get lost while traveling through the forest. Spooky stuff happens. 

**Always a Witch**: on Netflix, it’s in Spanish but has dub/subs. a witch travels to the future, our present day. She had to adjusts to our modern times. 

And uhm **the Witches**: family film, just watch it.

1641,TraditionalGuide8902,3,"mindhunters. inexperienced but talented profilers are on a isolated-military island and they are getting murdered one by one. it‘s my favorite whodunit. the kills are quite equal to the ones of horror movies.

murder by death. very similar to clue. probably the most similar one. it‘s a mystery with a lot of comedy. it‘s so confusing, something that clue was as well.

blood work. 

rather howdunit. fracture. and also law abiding citizen. both are great. fracture is kind of long.

Les Rivières pourpres. there are 2 movies. I didn‘t like the second one. It got a series. 8 episodes with 4 cases. I don‘t know the english title.

d-tox.

the sherlock holmes movies with robert downey jr. there are also series: sherlock and elementary.

agatha christie movies. peter ustinov made six. 3 are top tier whodunit‘s. murder at the orient express. there are two versions. I prefer the 70’s version. and then there was none. I prefer the 1945‘s version. family guy made a huge episode about it and it was great.

the 30+ edgar wallace movies of the 60‘s. 
 
the usual suspects 

seven

the bone collector. must watch. seriously.

the prestige

the name of the rose

memento

shutter island

copycat

murder by numbers

taking lives

the alex cross movies starring morgan freeman.

The 3 ??? if you want a softer one at some times. there are two movies.






horror movies who are whodunit‘s. some slashers have a great mystery plot.

sleepy hollow.

cherry falls. great whodunit. 

scream. all movies and the series. the series has 3 seasons. first two seasons are part of the same story which ends on a cliffhanger with the halloween special. s3 is a new story with 6 episodes. we will get a fifth movie in the next years.

a series: slasher. 3 seasons, all are a individual story. s2 was the best in my point of view. 

another series: harpers island. one season only.

my bloody valentine. there is a version of the 80‘s and 2009. they aren‘t 100% the same. 

sorority row

club mad. iam not the biggest fan but maybe you like it.

dead body. lowbudget but it has some kind of charme. 

happy birthday to me. 

urban legend. i only watched the first two movies.

happy deathday 1&amp;2.

valentine.

sleepaway camp. it‘s kind of a mystery movie. the ending is one of the craziest ones I‘ve ever seen.

[Resident Evil (2002)](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/)
I think this movie really deserves better ratings, but the ratings it got were skewed by the countless people who were upset about it not being more like the games.

[Doom (2005)](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0419706/)
This movie got shit on a lot, but I think that was because it fit so well with the game. It was fun for me, but extremely cheesy and full of lazy storytelling.

[Silent Hill (2006)](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/)
This is one of the most beautiful movies I’ve seen. The visuals and atmosphere are amazing as well as the sound track (in my opinion)

All of these movies are widely regarded as terrible movies, but I liked them a lot. They’re all guilty pleasures of mine. The fact that most of them are video game adaptations is purely coincidental.

Yes you are the product but you can also control how you use social media. All you need is awareness and the knowledge of how social media works. Once you understand the difference between facts vs opinions vs fake news, it wouldnt really take much for you to differentiate right vs wrong.

Social media is new and unfortunately with everything new you need time to get used to it. We are the generation that is the experiment for the next generation to learn from, the same way smoking was an experiment on our grand parents' generation and obesity was our parents'.

To talk a little more on it - For years, tobacco companies and governments denied any health risk associated with it. The government let a bunch of people die from cancer to then realize and force these companies to issue warning labels and contribute to anti-smoking campaigns and now smoking rates are at a historically low level. 

I think this is whats going to be the future. Let Facebook influence a few countries' election, let those countries realized that they were absolutely fucked and then have them put resources in creating awareness. 


As a father, I am honestly less worried about someone abusing my daughter on Instagram than her considering Logan Paul as her role model because the latter is just too difficult to fix. The former, you can just go to any celebrities page, show the vile comments, educate that this is unfortunately the reality of an anonymous internet, show her how to use the block button, give her self confidence, take a vacation and done but arguing why Logan Paul should not be a role model and suddenly I am the old guy who just does not understand the current generation.

Unfortunately to put in bluntly, you are part of an experiment just like people who walked on earth before you were. And if you come out on the positive side, you're the winner. 

Mexico is unfortunately going through something similar. Due to Nafta, US continues to export high fructose corn syrup products to them and the government cant do shit. This has caused a huge spike in obesity there. These obese people are unfortunately the results of an experiment that the new generation will learn from.

I think the documentary breaks it down really well and challenges the audience to think more critically about the services we use. Even things like Reddit. Though it's anonymous, it's reasonable to assume that they are watching/measuring engagement - things like how long we spend in certain subreddits, what posts we upvote, save, comment on, etc. This then influences the sorting of our front page and the ads, and etc. Though reddit *feels* like we have control given that much of reddit is opt-in, I would still be wary. 

This is a soapbox opinion so feel free to ignore. lol But imo, I think we all need to think more critically about what we're comfortable with the companies doing and what we're not. Are we really getting sufficient happiness/joy/etc from instagram/fb/reddit even for the potential pitfalls? Are we taking defensive steps to make sure that we're not building addictive loops, etc. At least in the US, the burden unfortunately falls on the individual to protect themselves as the government has not yet caught up from a regulatory perspective on some of the addictive behaviors that these platforms encourage.",False,1600364569,g5lxu4j,t3_iuk5cl,t3_iuk5cl,False

The English dub is also really good, felt the whole cast was great and I didn't find it too off putting or distracting.

**Once (2007)** - Irish romance/drama that is the best romance movie ever made, imo. Slow burn that's driven by pure undeniable chemistry, also a must watch if you enjoy the utilization of music in plots.

**Buffalo '66 (1998)** - quirky, off kilter, unique, and downright weird at times. Has a certain charm about it, either you like it or don't understand the appeal, but a must watch regardless.

**Tramps (2016)** - A truly underrated and underappreciated gem. Has the comedic elements of 500 Days of Summer, but adds a bit of excitement and thrill.

**Spring (2014)** - Another where the chemistry between the leads is really palpable. Take the Before trilogy and sprinkle in some light horror elements and if that sparks your interest this is a must watch.

**Flipped (2010)** - May be a bit too juvenile, but it's perfectly executed. Genuinely one of the cutest and most heartwarming films ever made, it'll have you thinking about all the crushes you had growing up and how clueless we all were.",False,1600275367,g5hk60w,t3_itqco7,t3_itqco7,False

Cinematically, **Shutter Island** feels the closest. See also: **A Cure for Wellness**, since it was directed by the same guy who did the Ring. The American version of the Grudge also feels similar, but I think it's a lot cheesier.

In terms of an overall match, I think **Stir of Echoes** or **The Sixth Sense** would best fit the bill for what you're looking for.",False,1600219671,g5fcx5o,t3_it9fai,t3_it9fai,False

I don't know if it was your idea, but when people give the title of a classic, it's often because they really like it... There are thousands of classics, so any top 10 is already a personnal choice.

Anyways, 10 films that are possibly must-watch (classics) that i really love, from every era/place (and a * for those with a specially good cinematography).

- *Finis Terrae* (Epstein, 1929) *
- *A Canterbury Tale* (Powell/Pressburger, 1944) *
- *Burmese Harp* (Ichikawa, 1956)
- *A Man escaped* (Bresson, 1956)
- *The Mirror* (Tarkovski, 1975)
- *The Return of the prodigal son* (Chahine, 1976)
- *Furyo* (Oshima, 1983)
- *Devdas* (Bhansali, 2002) *
- *Buongiorno, Notte* (Bellochio, 2003)
- *Elephant* (Van Sant, 2003) *

In all that, *Furyo* is probably the more easy to start with. And i'm afraid nothing of that list looks like Tarantino cinema (which is awesome, by the way).",False,1600210125,g5evj4t,t3_itjc7y,t3_itjc7y,False

The question of 'good movies' without barely any direction comes up frequently enough I have this Copy+Paste for you. When it comes to good movies there are plenty of resources outside of the subreddit; such as, [AFI's Top 100](https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/), [IMDB Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/), [Letterboxd Top 250](https://letterboxd.com/visdave34/list/official-top-250-narrative-feature-films/), [Roger Ebert's Top 300](https://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies), [Rotten Tomatoes Top 100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/) and [They Shoot Pictures, Don't They Top 1000](https://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000.htm).

3223,unpleasantmovies,3,"How weird do you wanna go?

**Taxidermia** from 2006 is pretty weird and disturbing, also quite funny and stylishly made. Its kind of the story of the men in a family, generation after generation, each weirder than the other. Its pretty unique I'd say, haven't seen much like it - very uneasy and entertaining at the same time.

Then you got **The Greasy Strangler** (2016) which is a comedy that leans towards the weird and disgusting. Its kind of in the vein of Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job - but higher production value and more explicit.  Its pretty funny, and has a lot of absurd and uncomfortable scenes. 

Another one you might quite like is Ken Russels **The Devils** from 1971, about a conspiracy to frame a priest as a devil worshiping warlock in seventeenth century France - and a whole bunch of sexually frustrated nuns. Its beautifully made, very engaging and totally batshit. 

If you're not familiar with Takashi Miike, he has a bunch of pretty intense films - but I'd say **Visitor Q** (2001) is the one that combines weirdness with the disturbing most. Its also one of his absolute best, with the uncomfortable craziness increasing to a point were you just have to shake your head and laugh.   


Anyway, I have a list of films like this over on Mubi - you might find more stuff you like there:  [https://mubi.com/lists/unpleasant-movies](https://mubi.com/lists/unpleasant-movies)  


I also co-host a podcast called **Unpleasant Movies**, where we talk about films that are really hard to watch, but at the same time deals with its themes in a interesting way - typically with an artistic agenda. We've done I Stand Alone and Irreversible by Noe, and are currently focusing on Takashi Miike. The episodes go kind of in-depth, and we don't heed spoilers, so its best to have seen the films before or know that you never want to.  If that sound interesting check us out here:

3326,unpleasantmovies,3,"On of my favorite examples of this is Richard Linklaters **Tape** from 2001. The entire film is set in a motel room and has three characters played by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard.  Its a very tightly constructed chamber piece - if you watch through it a second time you realize that every small action, every thing the characters do and most of the set pieces are directly connected to the theme and narrative. Its seriously well written and the acting is top notch. Linklater manages to activate the space through limited means, using the camera and editing quite energetically at times - but always in a way that builds upon the tension between the characters. Its quite twisty, narrative wise, and doesn't always go where you think it will.   


I don't often see it mentioned but I think its one of his best films, and also serves as a very good study in dramaturgy. Its also a great way to see how little money is necessary if you have a great script and amazing actors at hand.

""Band of Brothers""

""Breaking Bad""

""Uncut Gems""

""Mad Max: Fury Road""

3394,ILoveTeles,1,"Trying to not spoil, but afraid the examples themselves are kind of spoiling:  Harvey, Fight Club, and The Shining are a few similar examples where characters who were real only to those in the story.  One may add Donnie Darko, Psycho, A Beautiful Mind (very subtle direct references to ABM in this movie actually) and I’m sure dozens of other examples. I would argue Psycho is one of the finest examples of this, and as much as I’d hate to ever watch Fight Club again, it’s a great example of imaginary characters driving the plot. 

The question implies a level of detail not implied in my statement “this kind of thing”.  I’ve seen a number of deathbed movies retelling ones life and several of imaginary characters. Some of the best are the posthumous Lean films (Lawrence of Arabia and Ghandi, for example).  This does bring up an interesting point that any retelling of one’s deathbed story is partially fabrication, coming from the view of the one passing, but that’s not what’s written here, it’s an implication the viewer may make.  

In an artistic sense, one may derive similar meaning from Kaufman’s own body of work, (like Anomolisa for example) but I don’t think that’s a problem at all.  His work has a lot to say about how we perceive the world so I think that’s fitting.   I’ve often heard it said that storytellers only really have one story to tell and are bound to retell it their entire career.  To be sure, the closing shot here RE-grounds this to reality to reinforce the reality and draw a distinction between the imagined and real, so I think the question of subtlety is moot.

They stand out as characters and are quirky ... in the case of Kaufman I find this style to be to jarring and because of this hard to get into while the Cohen Brothers maintain attention by giving each and every quirky character the same weight and depth achieving a key balance. In Kaufman we must connect with and attempt to understand the few quirky characters we get... where as the Cohen Brothers grab the attention because we can compare and understand equally across all the characters.

There are a few movies that are based on the premise of time loops or remaking decisions, my pick of the bunch would be:

Palm springs - good light hearted comedy

the tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow - Sci-Fi and action built into this too

Source code - with Jake Gyllenhall, its like a mystery thriller where he has to find a bomber on a train but keeps going back to the start of the day everytime he fails.

3969,bill_lee,1,"I think you're misinterpreting my post slightly. The premise is fine. In no way do I think it needs a ""political advisor,"" and it certainly doesn't have to be realistic to be a great movie. For example, I love Jaws, but understand that sharks don't generally stalk and murder a boatload of people. It's just great movie making. Transversely, I think the East is a bad movie. I think the script is bad. I think the acting is bad. I also find it's portrayal of political activism ignorant to the point of being offensive, and sometimes it's difficult to see something that has importance and receives very little mainstream coverage, get trampled beyond recognition by the Hollywood machine. 

If it is supposed to be a popcorn fantasy movie, why didn't they sell it as that? Why did they choose to mercilessly bog this movie down in self-importance? I never felt duped by Lucy into taking it seriously, and it turns out it wasn't. I didn't watch the trailer for Limitless and go, ""I bet this is going to be a dead-serious treatise on drug-induced intelligence expansion,"" and it wasn't. Both of those movies seemed to be exactly what they were sold as...fun movie-going experiences. I don't watch those movies expecting anything else. I think The East was trying really, really hard to be taken very, very seriously. I think the screenwriter, the filmmakers, and the actors all saw it that way. I think they wanted this to be, ""an important movie.""  Maybe I'm wrong. This is all just conjecture on my part, after all. Maybe they were really trying to make Lucy, and it all just went over my head. But I don't think so. 

If you enjoy The East, that's totally fine. I guarantee you that I enjoy many movies that you might not like. I also guarantee that we have many movies in common that we would both endorse. The East is not going to be one of them though. And that's fine too. There are always going to be ""people that do critics like you did,"" in this world. There are always going to be opinions that may oppose yours, and thank god for it, right? 

For what its worth, I appreciate your lengthy and thoughtful reply, and I'm glad you feel as passionate about movies as I do. Cheers.",False,1600110232,g59nuqo,t1_g57pk9y,t3_is189x,False

4062,joealdez,2,"I only watched only 10 seconds of the trailer before i quit and thought ""the voice acting sounds brilliant (watched it in German) and this could be good...I'll watch it this evening"".

Boy was this movie different from what I expected :D  

I expected some kind of rom com or a ""typical"" romance drama and was hit with this thing. But, even if it was completely different from what I expected, I really enjoyed this movie. If you don't mind watching movies which:

*take their time to develop themselves (first 20 minutes is the protagonists having a converstaion in the car)
*focus on conversation (there's no action going on)
*give much room for interpretations 

then you could like this movie. This movie is full of metaphors, tiny details and mysteries but doesn't quite give an explanation to what is going on. 

**My Interpretation ----Spoilers**

Jake is an old man who works as a Janitor at a High School and everything we saw of ""young Jake and Lucy"" is in his imagination. He is lonely, sad and maybe sick -and because of that, he knowingly created an imaginary world, where he is young,has a girlfriend and everything is better. 

**Who is Lucy?:**  The Lucy that we know, is an imaginary version of a woman that Jake saw years ago. In the scene where imaginary Lucy meets the real Jake, she tells him (and us) how she experienced this evening. They didn't talk and he doesn't know her name or what she does for a living. That's why her name (Lucy, Lucia, Louise) and her profession (physicist, gerontologist, painter ) change throughout the movie. The only constant thing about imaginary Lucy is the way she looks and sounds.  That fact that imaginary Lucy talks to real Jake is making it obvious, that he knowingly created that imaginary world and isn't just delusional. 

**Jake's life regarding his parents:** 
* Jake lived with his parents all his life and he took care of them when they were getting old (mom getting a tinnitus and later bedridden, dad getting Alzheimer's). Jake was an ambitious (he won a prize) man who was clever(""genius""), a good painter and knows a lot about literature and other stuff.  That's what the scenes in the house tell us. 

*Some details (like imaginary Jake moving his head away from his mother ) make me think that  he is blaming them a bit for his misery -  ""I couldn't pursue my dreams because I had to take care of you"".


**Jake's life regarding women:**  Jake always had problems with women  and he knows about how he comes off to women. This is shown in several scenes during the movie: 
e.g. When real Jake is working, two schoolgirls are making fun of him behind his back.  The lonely girl walking the corridors is just looking at him and the schoolgirl singing the musical is looking at him in disgust.  All these girls show up later, e.g. when imaginary Jake and Lucy are at the Tootsietown and he tells Lucy that  people sometime can be cold to him and that she has to order because no one will come, if it's only him.

 The aforementioned scene of imaginary Lucy meeting real Jake also shows that he is aware of how he comes off to women. 


**Why do I think that Jake might be sick?:** When imaginary Jake shows imaginary Lucy the barn, Lucy asks Jake what happened to the pigs. He told her that they died - being eaten alive from the inside be maggots.  I think that is a metaphor to Jake - he is the (fat) pig. Maybe he is having a tumor and he knows thatr this thing is eating him alive until he dies. Maybe his thoughts and emotions are eating him alive - he is constantly questioning himself ""what if..?"" , which is making him miserable.",False,1600093819,g58eqde,t3_isi9n2,t3_isi9n2,False

I felt this was a meta-joke trying to turn the audience into the Robert McKee character from Adaptation.  This would better work as a special feature to THAT movie, or a DVD COMMENTARY featuring Brian Cox in character lamenting the VO and “don’t waste my time  / have something to say”.

While I feel like I got at least most of the references from the room (I did think the Pauline Kael impression was particularly great), the whole thing felt like an overwrought first draft from a first time screen writer with a lot to prove.  While I’m glad I watched it (mainly because I’ve always wondered about a screenplay taking lonesome neurosis to an extreme by having full quotations of Oscar speeches a person had rewatched or similar specific occurrences), I can see this kind of thing just doesn’t work. Even if you get the references, it’s not because you’re aiming at the smartest person in the audience, it’s just a fluke. 

From a “figuring it out” perspective, I took this as an unfinished screenplay written by the janitor early on in his life and everything more or less fit that narrative until later on.

But it took me a few days afterwards and the fact that my mind kept coming back to the movie to finally appreciate and like it.

Sure, those movies are pretty bad and also deal with some subject matters really irresponsibly, but I wouldn't exactly call the politics of transformers responsible either.

Anything dumb and also targeted at women, especially teenage girls, catches way, way more shit than it deserves. I don't think anybody was ever making Stephanie Meyer out to be a literary Mozart",False,1600077333,g57t260,t1_g57qi03,t3_is9ckb,False

Tony Montana is not really presented as sympathetic, as Travis is. Tony is a psychopathic murder throughout. A pretty clear villain protagonist. Travis' acts could be seen as an act of good, even though his motives are self serving, and he is unstable, as shown by the end. So, he's a little more complicated.

Its like people hating on Lucy and limitless because the premise is false (that its not true that you don't use 10% of your brain and that you can unlock the rest somehow). Even if the premise is false, you can watch the movie and enjoy it, can't you? I am always surprised when I read critics saying: I hated that movie because it's not true that you can take a pill and unlock the other 90% of your brain. Are you that stubborn that you couldn't go through the first 5 minutes of the movie? There are E.Ts in that movie, and the thing that stopped you from watching it is the premise?

Did you start watching The East thinking it would be a documentary? No then why does it matter?

 Sure, they took a stance and a political one, but its fiction so you do what you want with it. It never claimed to be 100% accurate. Plus, unless its factual taking political stance doesn't mean that you have to be accurate. 

Let's say you were watching Food inc. and it tells you about the food industry but it spreads lies, sure you would be right to criticize it for not being factual as it's trying to convince you that the meat industry is totally wrong-doing. 

But I don't think you need a political advisor to create fiction like in The East as much as you don't need a political advisor to create James Bond or The Hunger games. 

The same thing happened in the movie Michael Clayton, its a mix of real events and fiction and people go mad about it being non-factual. Who cares? The movie isn't trying to brainwash you, it's not trying to throw some propaganda at you, it's showing you a possible outcome and a possible build-up to events through fiction.

First of all, I don't think either of those filmmakers would have intended you to 'idolize' either of those guys.  They're both very, very broken people, and both films can work as cautionary tales against some of our worst and darkest instincts.

That is different from understanding characters, have empathy for characters, or seeing yourself (both good and bad) in characters.

But the two you have picked, and the fact that you mention 'idolizing' them, makes me think you're looking at these movies as ""cool anti-hero"" types, and I think that's missing a lot of meat on the bone.

I would say a good movie to recommend would be Fight Club.  It definitely covers the topic of a 'masculine Mary Sue' and the danger of that.  If you haven't seen it, I think you'll like it, and it gets to the heart of what you're asking about.

4470,TB54,3,"I have the feeling that all that you will find will more be a ""visual"" world than a world with its own thematic rules.

- Some Méliès films, while being very short films, are really rich and have the first signs of a world building, at least visually coherent - you see it in *The Impossible Voyage*, *A Trip to the Moon*, *The Kingdom of the Fairies*...

- The Danish film *A Trip to Mars* (Holger-Madsen, 1914) creates a fantasized civilized Mars, but it's more a metaphor (the world you meet there is inhabited by humans, or at least humans look-alike) than a real new universe, even if it has it's own style (ancient Greece style, to sum-up).

- German expressionism builds a lot of fantasized worlds (*Caligari*, *The Golem*...), but it's more visually once again. 

- With *King Kong*-like films (exotic/fantastic/horror of those years) you can try *The Lost World* (1925) or *Island of Lost Souls* (1932).

- *A Matter of Life and Death* (Powell/Pressburger, 1946) invent its own version of paradise, but it's still paradise and not a whole new universe. 

- Later, *Beauty and the Beast* by Cocteau and *Donkey Skin* by Demy, even if they are famous tales adaptations, build their own personnal universe around them (it's mostly true for the demy film).

- I have the feeling that the thing more close to what you're searching for are serials, like *Flash Gordon* (who inspired *Star Wars* - 1936&gt;1940), but i don't know it very well. I suppose that a lof of SF B-movie from the 50' have also something to offer, but it's not always convincing.

This little indie is one of my favorite films of all time. It was my introduction to Michael Fassbender, and I was instantly smitten (although my crush was mellowed by the revelation that his character was actually a dickhead, lol.)
