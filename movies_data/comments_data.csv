It's well known that A Face in the Crowd is based on Will Rogers. 

&gt;‚ÄúArkansas Traveler‚Äù and ultimately *Crowd* originated in an  exchange between Schulberg and Will Rogers, Jr., son of the entertainer  and down-home wit. Schulberg was talking about his father, prompting  Rogers ‚Äì who was then running for congress on the strength of his famous  name ‚Äì to exclaim, ‚ÄúMy father was so full of shit, because he pretends  he‚Äôs just one of the people, just one of the guys ‚Ä¶ but in our house the  only people that ever came as guests were the richest people in town,  the bankers and the power-brokers of L.A. And those were his friends and  that‚Äôs where his heart is and he \[was\] really a goddamned reactionary.‚Äù  The conversation lodged in Schulberg‚Äôs memory, eventually morphing into  the rise-and-fall story of hillbilly folksinger/TV star/quasi-fascist  demagogue Lonesome Rhodes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The successes of Arthur Godfrey and Tennessee Ernie Ford were also acknowledged in the screenplay.  

I'm not trying to denigrate Rogers. I'm just saying he was a populist entertainer who wielded political influence in much the same way. And yes, I'm not an idiot. I know he worked in radio and stage. There was no television. A Face in the Crowd is about television.
