Note that I've already watched all the big mafia movies (including titles like the Departed, American Gangster, and Irishman)

Here are the ones already on my watch list:

* Bonanno, a Godfather's story
* Bugsy
* Find me Guilty
* Kill the Irishman
* Lucky Luciano (1979)
* Lansky (1998)
* Valachi Papers
* Public Enemies - don't think this one really is exclusively a mafia movie, but crime-related
* Nitti the Enforcer
* Road to Perdition
* Gangs of New York
* The Iceman
* Once Upon a Time in Queens
* Hoodlum
* This Thing of Ours
* The Don is Dead
* By The Gun
* Gotti (1996)
* Wiseguys (1986)

Out of those movies just listed, are any of them unwatchable, as in they are terrible and I shouldn't waste my time with them?

Also, any other suggestions would be great!",tt0901507%tt0221073

iwio9m,2020-09-20 12:57:45,"Could you please suggest some comedies based on how I feel about the movies in the description? I'm looking for hilarious movies, and plot isn't the most important thing, but a nice bonus","I asked here a little while back and I got some really good suggestions, but I noticed a trend of movies that were very plot driven and less funny. They were definitely well made movies, but I'm moreso looking for laughs above all else. 

Here is a list of comedies that I didn't like and turned off around halfway through:
1. Me, Myself, and Irene
2. Step Brothers
3. Half Baked

Here is a list of movies that I thought were decent, but didn't really find funny:
1. 21/22 Jump Street
2. Rushmore

Here is a list of movies that I thought were good, but only find kinda funny:
1. Something About Mary
2. Outside Providence
3. Pineapple Express
4. Booksmart

Here is a list of movies that I thought were decent and had a fair amount of laughs but not quite enough:
1. Knocked Up
2. Eurotrip
3. Road Trip
4. Idiocracy
5. 40 Year Old Virgin

Here is a list of movies that I found to be outstanding and were funny, but could've been funnier:
1. Dazed and Confused
2. Fast Times at Ridgemont High
3. Role Models

Here is a list of movies that I found to be hilarious, and a ""+"" by them if I thought they were also really good:
1. Blockers +
2. American Pie Series+
3. Wedding Crashers+
4. Office Space+
5. Superbad+
6. Scary Movie series
7. Good Boys


Here are some memorable scenes from movies that I uncontrollably laughed at:
1. Blockers https://youtu.be/Qb6-2QQvcfw
2. Blockers https://youtu.be/Eu1EfSDUKFg - honestly I laughed the entire movie; Blockers is the funniest movie ever made imo
3. Band Camp https://youtu.be/nlH_5ejw7Gs - ONLY the triangle part, and I thought this movie sucked
4. Eurotrip https://youtu.be/_MrBpmM5YAM
5. Office Space https://youtu.be/jKYivs6ZLZk - any scene with Milton, too
6. American Wedding https://youtu.be/J0W8YdkSI5c
7. American Wedding 
https://youtu.be/nqz6wwDRWiE
8. American Wedding https://youtu.be/4lat6XqtJ0A
9. Scary Movie https://youtu.be/5eI24fookyA

Note: I've seen every Adam Sandler movie. It's been a while, but I remember the general plots. They were pretty good and pretty funny. 

Family Guy is also my favorite show of all time and I could watch it all day. So yeah, following the trend of hilarious but not really a plot.

I'm still not sure it's GOOD exactly, and it's stupid that you have to read the comic book (which is on the bluray, which is nice at least), but something about it just really resonated with me.

Krysta Now especially feels like a total prediction of the kind of industry the Kardashians became, and the idea of the world going crazy and feverishly spiraling toward the apocalypse during an election year felt creepily prescient to me too.

ivdqgm,2020-09-18 15:19:01,The Abyss," 

Hi Everyone. I had originally posted this on r/movies but someone suggested I post it here as well.

 I d like to tell you about my favorite movie. The Abyss. It was released in 1989 and Directed by James Cameron. I stars Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Micheal Biehn, and is supported by a very talented cast. This movie takes place almost entirely underwater as the Navy uses a cutting edge submersible oil rig to help them locate a crashed submarine in an abyss as a massive hurricane is barreling down on their location. One of the divers has an encounter with a small ""dance of light"" and tries to convince everyone that she saw an alien of some sort. The Navy SEALs that have come down to the rig to lead the mission see the encounter as a threat and automatically think it is the Russians. They take the small sub named CAB 1 to retrieve a nuclear warhead from the sub just as the crew needs it to unhook the umbilical cable that is feeding them power and oxygen. upon their return, the crew scrambles to get the umbilical disconnected but are unsuccessful because the crane on the ship crashes into the ocean and falls dangerously close to the rig and the cliff that it sits atop. The crane falls over the cliff and begins to drag the rig toward the abyss and only by sheer luck it stops before going over and falling into the depths below where it most certainly will be crushed by the pressure. During the slide, massive damage was done to the rig and many of the crew lost their lives. They are sitting on the edge and are running out of air. Now the battle to convince the SEAL team not to set off a nuclear bomb begins. Watch to find out the rest.

There are two versions the theatrical and extended versions. I of course recommend the extended version because it is a more complete move. the theatrical version had what I feel important plot points removed for the sake of time.

iukc0f,2020-09-17 09:16:54,Arrival (2016)," Just saw the movie and it was great and very thought-provoking. However, I'm no linguist, but I'd imagine learning/translating a totally alien language would be next to impossible, especially in such a short span of time. Language is shaped by culture and it may not be possible to learn much of the alien language without understanding their culture and history first, especially for a written language. Even learning simple greetings would be extremely difficult since that's also entrenched in culture and history. In the movie, they taught and learned from the aliens using gestures, pictures, and movements, but I'm not sure if that's enough. At the very least it'd take years. It's a good one.

iu5dby,2020-09-16 16:36:40,How many days have you watched the Misterios de Lisboa?,"I have heard about it to be released in a festival (2010) and seen the duration (4h32min) I said I can not watch it in the theatre without a break.

But it has been on my mind since then and  I finally reserved three days to watch it. 

With its creative and unusuall scenes and diaologues, costumes and production designing, it is really wonderful. 

The film is tiring but not boring and during three evenings I always wondered the secrets following and unexpected in every passage. 

La Commune (paris) had been released in a museum at scope of another festival and its long about 6 hours, I watched only one hour because I wondered the film and the commune.      

A film about Colomb, starring by Gerard de Pardieu longs four houres and I had seen it in TV at a Saturday night till morning. (Before the invention of internet)   

Let's turn to the Lisboa, it is a movie must see, human wants it not to end. For it is leaving traditional scene designing and dialogues stream, it does not bore at all.

iu2wx0,2020-09-16 14:39:27,Django Unchained,"This being a Tarantino film, you know that the violence and gore is going to be WAY over the top, but once you're prepared for that (and believe me, there is a LOT of blood in this one), the movie is very hard to stop watching!

The movie looks gorgeous and the dialogue was great, as you would expect from a Tarantino film.  I thought that Christopher Waltz and Jamie Foxx were great as the mismatched bounty hunter team.

The subject matter of the film (slavery) is something that really ratchets up the tension of every scene.  The movie shines a light on an extremely uncomfortable subject for Americans and brings a ton of baggage with it.  I think that uneasiness really makes the movie more captivating because you're witnessing the utter brutality of the situation mixed in with the chance for two people to escape from that reality.  You really end up very sympathetic towards Django by the end of the movie.  I don't think you'd get nearly as interesting of a movie if this were just an updated spaghetti western.

So, highly recommend this movie UNLESS you are squeamish about blood and guts, in which case, you should stay FAR FAR away.",tt1396484%tt1637688%tt0022100%tt0436364%tt0068646%tt2059255%tt0139239%tt0103874%tt0387564

isrkba,2020-09-14 14:04:17,If you loved The before trilogy.... You need to check out 303,"So I just watched this German movie called 303 (2018) and I fell in love with the movie. 
It's about two strangers who are University students who go on a road trip for different reasons. 

This movie reminded me strongly of the before trilogy as the entire movie is based on conversations and the chemistry between the two lead actors. The dialogues revolve around capitalism, love, philosophy, evolution and just so many other interesting things. The dialogues are so natural that it's hard to belive that it comes from a script
The movie really makes you want to packup your bag, meet a stranger and fall in love. 
Everything about the movie- the landscapes, the acting, the music, the storyline, the adventures- everything just makes you feel good. 


I would highly recommend this movie.. and would love to know your thoughts?",tt2283748%tt1396484%tt0448134%tt1637688%tt3774694%tt1049413%tt0112462%tt6857112%tt2848292%tt0112471%tt0194314%tt2059255%tt0387514%tt0465203%tt1294688%tt0436364

I'll be honest, I don't think I pieced everything together, so I might need to rewatch again or maybe gain some context on the couple of things that confused me. But what I did take away from it and from my understanding was a powerful sense of loneliness and sadness. The long drawn out car scenes were extremely tense, I was hanging on every word. The night at the parents house equally so and also chilling and unnerving. The acting is suburb all round.

isabqa,2020-09-13 19:32:08,Help me find anime with similar style [more in description],"Hello everybody!

Last month, I have entered in anime world and discovered one of the best visual shows in my life. It is the work of Yoshiaki Kawajiri .  I saw everything from him and  visual style with crazy good drawings of characters is just best ever!  Most of the anime from 80s-2000s kinda look better then now-days animations, in my opinion.

Things like:

 "" Ninja Scroll"",

"" Highlander: The Search For Vengeance"", 

""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""

""Redline""

Those were few examples of visual style and atmosphere I like.  I am not sure who is most responsible for this crazy good vibe in those anime besides Director Kawajiri.

So if you can help me find key people from those animations I listed above. Or if you could recommend me some similar stuff feel free to do it, because I will be grateful for life!

-not ""try hard"" sexy
-not an overly sexual film
-tattoos/brown hair are a bonus but not a necessity 

Genre doesn't matter

But some examples of some guys I that made me feel like that:

-Jack Dawson (Titanic)
-Jughead Jones (Riverdale)
-Jacob Black (Twilight)

Just guys that are sweet, romantic and/or mysterious

Also please note, those films are NOT my typical taste. 99% of what I watch is psychological thrillers and they don't tend to have cute dudes 

This is very random and I feel ashamed for this but I'm just lonely lmao

OR a series like outer banks where there's lots of beautiful men to choose from

(just nothing cringy like that film with that necky noah dude)

EDIT: I'm not into ""manly"" men. I don't know how else to word it but guys like Ryan Gosling, Chris Hemsworth, Zac Efron etc. The guys I like (see examples) are all very smooth faced pretty boys. Yeah, the guys that most other people find attractive do nothing for me for some reason, it's very inconvenient",tt0119313%tt0309987%tt4481414%tt1441912%tt0256415%tt0103874%tt0098258%tt2459156%tt0970468%tt1049413%tt0119229%tt0499549%tt2183034%tt2486678%tt0240890%tt2279339%tt2058673%tt0457275%tt0421715%tt0088794%tt1396484%tt0318462%tt0088680%tt3783958%tt3369806%tt1560139%tt0390022%tt0101748%tt1179794%tt0096018%tt1327194%tt1512235%tt1726669%tt0110322%tt0436364%tt1289403%tt2597242%tt2194499%tt0108550%tt1120985%tt3778644%tt0406977%tt3458510%tt0138097%tt0486655%tt0245574%tt0264464%tt3882082%tt3774694%tt1707386%tt0126871%tt0203009%tt0120667%tt0023649%tt0387514%tt1836808%tt0117802%tt0032943%tt0105265%tt0116722%tt0265808%tt0114168%tt0981227%tt0097493%tt5304992%tt8085790%tt0108451%tt0443453%tt6053438%tt0209933%tt3104988%tt0117038%tt1276419%tt3165612%tt2848292%tt0109424%tt0116168%tt0275022%tt0022100%tt0274812%tt0108327%tt0840322%tt5308322%tt0111503%tt1645131%tt1781058%tt4139124%tt2872718%tt1084972%tt1570728%tt0391304%tt0780504%tt0097240%tt0283111%tt1798709%tt0102494%tt2091935%tt2023587%tt2764784%tt0460791%tt1655441%tt1588170%tt4298958%tt0183790%tt2690138

I liked *In Bruges* (2008) (no fights almost, but great everything else, not like Ava which had a cliché story and the character build up was in the fucking intro jesus christ) but I also liked the john wicks (a lot of fights, but well choregraphed fights, not like in fucking Ava where it makes zero sense, horrible)
